See NewsqueakIA32ABIPlugin for the VM code that actually implements call-outs and call-backs.\r\rSee the class-side examples category for some simple example workspaces.\r\rAliens represent ABI (C language) data.  They can hold data directly in their bytes or indirectly by pointing to data on the C heap.  Alien instances are at least 5 bytes in length. The first 4 bytes of an Alien hold the size, as a signed integer, of the datum the instance is a proxy for.  If the size is positive then the Alien is \"direct\" and the actual datum resides in the object itself, starting at the 5th byte.  If the size is negative then the proxy is \"indirect\", is at least 8 bytes in length and the second 4 bytes hold the address of the datum, which is assumed to be on the C heap.  Any attempt to access data beyond the size will fail.  If the size is zero then the Alien is a pointer, the second 4 bytes hold a pointer, as for \"indirect\" Aliens, and accessing primitives indirect through the pointer to access data, but no bounds checking is performed.\r\rWhen Aliens are used as parameters in FFI calls then all are \"passed by value\", so that e.g. a 4 byte direct alien will have its 4 bytes of data passed, and a 12-byte indirect alien will have the 12 bytes its address references passed.  Pointer aliens will have their 4 byte pointer passed.

Author, Friend, Colleague. \thttp://forum.world.st/In-Memory-of-Andreas-Raab-td4663424.html\r\tReleased by Ron, Julie and David\r\rExample:\rAndreasSystemProfiler spyOn: [ 10000 timesRepeat: [ 3.14159 printString ] ]\r\r-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\rApparently, the time taken to run the provided block is as twice as long as run without the profiler.\r\r-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\rBoth AndreasSystemProfiler and MessageTally are periodic sampling profilers.  The essential difference between AndreasSystemProfiler and MessageTally is in how the current method is sampled.\r\rMessageTally is driven from a high-priority process in a loop waiting on a delay.  When the delay fires the lower-priority process being profiled is interrupted, its stack is walked to determine the methods along the call chain, and that data is recorded.  But since the sampling occurs when the high-priority process preempts the lower-priority process, a sample is only taken at a preemption point.  In particular, primitives are *not* profiled because they are not suspension points.  A process can only be suspended on method activation (a non-primitive method activation, or primitive failure) or on backward branch.  The cost of primitives is charged to a caller and is inferred by subtracting the cost of children of the caller from the caller itself (subtracting the number of samples in children of the caller form the number of samples in the caller itself).  \r\rAnother problem is that using the clock that underlies Delay, which is typically the clock used by processes being profiled, causes sampling errors due to the sampling and sampled processes cohering.  Delays are limited in resolution (at best 1 millisecond) so if the profiled process waits on a delay it'll fire immediately after the profiling process (because the profiling process is at higher priority) and so the sampling process may only ever see the sampled process in a wait state.\r\rIf MessageTally is used to profile multiple processes then a third problem is that if a primitive causes a process switch then its cost will end up being charged to the process switched-to, not switched from.  This is again because sampling can only occur after a primitive has completed (successfully or not).\r\rAndreasSystemProfiler is driven from a high-priority process in a loop waiting on a Semaphore known to the VM.  The profiling process uses a primitive to schedule a sample some number of ticks of the VM's high-performance clock in the future.  When the time is reached the VM samples the current method and the current process, *before any process preemption takes place*, and independently of the standard clock, and signals the semaphore.  The profiling process then collects the method,process pair via primitives.  So AndreasSystemProfiler provides much more accurate results.\r\rThat said there are still limitations with primitives and Cog.  Currently Cog only samples \"interpreter\" primitives.  Those primitives it implements in machine code (integer and float arithmetic, closure evaluation, at:, identityHash) are not sampled and won't show up; they will be charged to the calling method.  This is fixable, since Cog actually compiles the sampling direct into interpreter primitive invocation when profiling is in effect and not at other times, but sampling could be a significant cost in these simple and performance-critical primitives.","superclass":"Object","subclasses":[],"name":"AndreasSystemProfiler"},{"package":"Tools-Test","depth":5,"comment":"SUnit tests for AndreasSystemProfiler","superclass":"TestCase","subclasses":[],"name":"AndreasSystemProfilerTest"},{"package":"Images-Animated","depth":3,"comment":"I am a single frame in a sequence of frames that comprise an animated image.

The source of pixels may be a similar rectangle (at sourceX, sourceY) in the sourceForm, or a constant color, currently called halftoneForm.  If both are specified, their pixel values are combined with a logical AND function prior to transfer.  In any case, the pixels from the source are combined with those of the destination by as specified by the combinationRule.\r\rThe combination rule whose value is 0 through 15 programs the transfer to produce 1 or 0 according to its 4-bit representation as follows:\r\t8:\tif source is 0 and destination is 0\r\t4:\tif source is 0 and destination is 1\r\t2:\tif source is 1 and destination is 0\r\t1:\tif source is 1 and destination is 1.\rAt each pixel the corresponding bits of the source and destination pixel values determine one of these conditions;  if the combination rule has a 1 in the corresponding bit position, then the new destination value will be 1, otherwise it will be zero.

Alpha blend of scaled srcWord and destWord.\r\rThe color specified by halftoneForm may be either a Color or a Pattern.   A Color is converted to a pixelValue for the depth of the destinationForm.  If a Pattern, BitBlt will simply interpret its bitmap as an array of Color pixelValues.  BitBlt aligns the first element of this array with the top scanline of the destinationForm, the second with the second, and so on, cycling through the color array as necessary.  Within each scan line the 32-bit value is repeated from left to right across the form.  If the value repeats on pixels boudaries, the effect will be a constant color;  if not, it will produce a halftone that repeats on 32-bit boundaries.\r\rAny transfer specified is further clipped by the specified rectangle (clipX, clipY, clipWidth, clipHeight), and also by the bounds of the source and destination forms.\r\tTo make a small Form repeat and fill a big form, use an InfiniteForm as the source.\r\tTo write on a form and leave with both transparent and opapue areas, use a MaskedForm as the source.\r\rPixels from a source to a destination whose pixels have a different depth are converted based on the optional colorMap.  If colorMap is nil, then conversion to more bits is done by filling the new high-order bits with zero, and conversion to fewer bits is done by truncating the lost high-order bits.  \r\rThe colorMap, if specified, must be a either word array (ie Bitmap) with 2^n elements, where n is the pixel depth of the source, or a fully specified ColorMap which may contain a lookup table (ie Bitmap) and/or four separate masks and shifts which are applied to the pixels. For every source pixel, BitBlt will first perform masking and shifting and then index the lookup table, and select the corresponding pixelValue and mask it to the destination pixel size before storing.\r\tWhen blitting from a 32 or 16 bit deep Form to one 8 bits or less, the default is truncation.  This will produce very strange colors, since truncation of the high bits does not produce the nearest encoded color.  Supply a 512 long colorMap, and red, green, and blue will be shifted down to 3 bits each, and mapped.  The message copybits...stdColors will use the best map to the standard colors for destinations of depths 8, 4, 2 and 1.  Two other sized of colorMaps are allowed, 4096 (4 bits per color) and 32786 (five bits per color).\r\tNormal blits between 16 and 32 bit forms truncates or pads the colors automatically to provide the best preservation of colors.\r\tColors can be remapped at the same depth.  Sometimes a Form is in terms of colors that are not the standard colors for this depth, for example in a GIF file.  Convert the Form to a MaskedForm and send colorMap: the list of colors that the picture is in terms of.  MaskedForm will use the colorMap when copying to the display or another Form.

You should find a copy of the paper here: http://www.ross.net/crc/. In this paper Ross describes a parameterized implementation that enables the different variations of the CRC algorithm to be used in a consistent way, simply by adjusting the parameters. If you don't have a clue about CRC (like me) then I strongly suggest reading the paper. It will also help you to understand how to make the best use of this implementation.\r\rThe \"CRC RevEng\" project on sourceforge implements Williams's \"RockSoft\" parameterized CRC program (as does this class) and comes with a handy list of parameters for various CRC algorithm: http://reveng.sourceforge.net/crc-catalogue/.\r\rFor ease of use and better performance, the two defacto standard variations \"CRC16\" and \"CRC32\" have been predefined. The lookup tables for these implementations are included on the class side. For all other variations the lookup table will be generated at runtime before the first run.\r\rIf you want to define your own algorithm you can do so by using the methods in the \"accessing-parameters\" protocol. Note that there are no default values. Here's a short overview:\r\t#width: \t\t\tdefines the width of the register (usually 16 or 32)\r\t#polynome: \t\tdefines the polynome to use for polynome division / lookup table creation\r\t#registerFill: \t\tdefines the start content of the working register (usually all ones or all zeros)\r\t#reflectInput: \t\tif true every byte will be reflected before processing (e.g. 100101 -> 101001)\r\t#reflectOutpu: \t\tif true the entire register will be reflected before the final XOR stage\r\t#finallyXorWith: \tdefines the final XOR for the entire register\r\t#lookupTable: \t\tthe only OPTIONAL parameter. The lookup table will be generated at runtime if none has been supplied\r\t#message: \t\t\tthe message to calculate the CRC on \r\t\t\r\rEXAMPLES\r=================\rThe simplest possible snippet uses the class side methods for \"CRC16\" and \"CRC32\":\r\tCRC crc16FromCollection: 'some message'. --> 55709\r\tCRC crc32FromCollection: 'some message'. --> 191312361\r\rLet's assume, you wanted to use \"CRC16 reversed\" (neither input nor output reflected). Then you would have to change the parameters like so (the reversed form uses a different polynome and a different start register content):\r\tcrc := CRC new\r\t\tbeCrc16;\r\t\tpolynome: 16r1021;\r\t\tregisterFill: 16rFFFF;\r\t\treflectInput: false;\r\t\treflectOutput: false;\r\t\tmessage: 'some message';\r\t\tyourself.\r\tcrc run. --> 46785\r\t\rUsing a single instance as in the code above will of course be faster than using the class side methods when performing multiple runs. But if you are really concerned about performance (see PERFORMANCE) you should use the \"raw\" methods (no checks! If you forget to set parameters there will be errors....):\r\tcrc := CRC new\r\t\tbeCrc16;\r\t\tmessage: 'some message';\r\t\tyourself.\r\tcrc runRefInRefOut. --> 55709\r\t\r\tcrc := CRC new\r\t\tbeCrc16;\r\t\tpolynome: 16r1021;\r\t\tregisterFill: 16rFFFF;\r\t\tmessage: 'some message';\r\t\tyourself.\r\tcrc runNonRefInNonRefOut. --> 46785\r\t\r\rPERFORMANCE\r=================\rThe performance of this implementation (tested for crc16) is equal to the performance of String>>crc16 if executed \"raw\" (see EXAMPLES). For the users sake however, the implementation does a few extra checks to improve ease of use. The cost is a loss of performance of about factor 1.15 (single instance) and 1.42 (one instance per run) (note that although I took an average of 10, the results will vary quite a bit each time you run the code):\r\tcrc := CRC new \r\t\tbeCrc16; \r\t\tmessage: 'this is a test message'; \r\t\tyourself.\r\t\r\t\"String>>crc16\"\t\r\ttimes := OrderedCollection new.\r\t10 timesRepeat: [ times add: [ 1000000 timesRepeat: [ 'this is a test message' crc16 ] ] timeToRun ].\r\ttimes average floor. --> 530\r\t\r\t\"raw\"\r\ttimes := OrderedCollection new.\r\t10 timesRepeat: [ times add: [ 1000000 timesRepeat: [ crc runRefInRefOut ] ] timeToRun ].\r\ttimes average floor. --> 535\r\t\r\t\"user friendly, one instance\"\t\r\ttimes := OrderedCollection new.\r\t10 timesRepeat: [ times add: [ 1000000 timesRepeat: [ crc run ] ] timeToRun ].\r\ttimes average floor. --> 616\r\t\r\t\"user friendly, one instance per run\"\r\ttimes := OrderedCollection new.\r\t10 timesRepeat: [ times add: [ 1000000 timesRepeat: [ CRC crc16FromCollection: 'this is a test message' ] ] timeToRun ].\r\ttimes average floor. --> 759","superclass":"Checksum","subclasses":[],"name":"CRC"},{"package":"Compression","depth":5,"comment":"CRC failed","superclass":"Error","subclasses":[],"name":"CRCError"},{"package":"System-Caching","depth":3,"comment":"I am CacheStatistics.\rI keep track of hits and misses of a cache.","superclass":"Object","subclasses":[],"name":"CacheStatistics"},{"package":"System-Caching","depth":3,"comment":"I  am CacheWeight.\rI keep track of the weight of a cache.\r\rThe weight of a cache is the sum of the weight of all values currently present.

See methods in the signatures protocol in subclasses of Callback for signature methods that decode the C stack and registers to invoke a callback with parsed arguments.  See Callback>>valueInContext: and subclass implementations for the evaluation of the signature method that invokes the callback block with correctly parsed arguments.  See Alien class>>invokeCallbackContext: for the entry-point for callbacks into the system from the VM.\r\rInstance Variables:\rblock <BlockClosure> - The Smalltalk code to be run in response to external code invoking the callback.\rthunk <FFICallbackThunk> - the wrapper around the machine-code thunk that initiates the callback and whose address should be passed to C\revaluator <Symbol> - the selector of the marshalling method to use; see methods in the signatures protocol in subclasses of Callback.\rnumEvaluatorArgs <Integer> - the arity of evaluator\rargsProxyClass <Alien subclass> - legacy; unused; the wrapper around the thunk's incoming stack pointer, used to extract arguments from the stack.\r\rClass Variables:\rThunkToCallbackMap <Dictionary of: thunkAddress <Integer> -> callback <Callback>> - used to lookup the Callback associated with a specific thunk address on callback.

Marshalling methods belong in concrete subclasses, one subclass for each ABI.\r\rSo e.g. with a callback of\r\t\tCallback\r\t\t\tsignature:  #(int (*)(const void *, const void *))\r\t\t\tblock: [ :arg1 :arg2 | ((arg1 doubleAt: 1) - (arg2 doubleAt: 1)) sign]\rthe marshalling methods are in one of Callback's concrete subclasses signatures protocol, for example\r\rCallbackForIA32>>voidstarvoidstarRetint: callbackContext sp: spAlien\r\t<signature: #(int (*)(const void *, const void *))>\r\t^callbackContext wordResult:\r\t\t(block\r\t\t\tvalue: (Alien forPointer: (spAlien unsignedLongAt: 1))\r\t\t\tvalue: (Alien forPointer: (spAlien unsignedLongAt: 5)))\r\rwhere spAlien is an Alien pointing to a VMCallbackContext32.\r\rFor ARM support, where there the first four integer arguments are passed in registers, we can use\r\rCallbackForARM32>>voidstarvoidstarRetint: callbackContext regs: regsAlien\r\t<signature: #(int (*)(const void *, const void *))>\r\t^callbackContext wordResult:\r\t\t(block\r\t\t\tvalue: (Alien forPointer: (regsAlien unsignedLongAt: 1))\r\t\t\tvalue: (Alien forPointer: (regsAlien unsignedLongAt: 5)))\r\rThe selector of the method doesn't matter, providing it doesn't conflict with any other, except for the number of arguments.  What's important is the pragma which defines the signature and the ABI for which this is a valid marshalling method.  Support for callee pop callbacks (Pascal calling convention such as the Win32 stdcall: convention) are supported using the <calleepops: N> pragma which specifies how many bytes to pop.\r\rWhen a callback is instantiated, Callback introspects to find the marshalling method that matches the signature for the current ABI.  If one doesn't already exist you can write one.  Hopefully we'll write an ABI compiler that will automatically generate these marshalling methods according to the platform's ABI, but for now its a manual process.; at least it's open and flexible.  When the callback is invoked the evaluator is performed with the current callbackContext and pointer(s) to the arguments.  There is a 32-bit and a 64-bit callback context, and it can have a stack pointer, integer register args and floating point register args, so it's general enough for any callback.\r\rTo pass back the result, a value is assigned into the struct via the accessor in the marshalling method and control returns to teh point where teh callback comes in, and this uses a primitive to return.  Inside the callbackContext is a jmpbuf from a setjmp.  The primitive longjmp's back to the entry point in the VM which extracts the result and the code for the kind of result and returns.

And when your package will be loaded the new annotation will be added into existing class.\r \rThere is no special way how instantiate annotation instances. It is up to your domain.\rThe internal state is initialized during Registry creation.  Users should not think about it. \rYou can add any domain specific variables to your annotations and add constructors to initialize them in declaration methods. \rAnnotations are just normal objects without any restrictions. You can also attatch annotations to annotations like in other languages.\r\r-----------Advanced features. Priority------------\r\rAnnotations in the registry are sorted by priority. It provides out of the box mechanizm for ordering annotated classes for the user domain purposes. \rJust pass priority number into the annotation when you create it in declaration method. And define suitable constructor for this.\r\r-----------Advanced features. Context------------\r\rAny annotation can be contextual. You can specify instance of context where annotation can be used:\r\tMySpecialAnnotation for: anAnotationContext\rContext describes annotation users where they should be active.\r\rFor simplicity you can specify any class instead of context instance. It will represent all users of annotation of particular class hierarchy:\r\r\tMySpecialAnnotation for: MyUserClass.\r\rInternallly argument is always converted to the context:\r\r\tMyUserClass asAnnotationContext.\r\rI provide query interface to retriev registered annotations which are active in given context:\r\r\tMySpecialAnnotation activeInstancesInContext: anAnnotationUser.\r\tMySpecialAnnotation activeInstancesInContext: anAnnotationUser do: [:ann | ].\r\tMySpecialAnnotation activeInstancesFor: MyClass inContext: anAnnotationUser do: [:ann | ].\r\rBy default the annotation is active if given user is described by declared context:\r\r\tClassAnnotation>>isActiveInContext: anAnnotationUser\r\t\t^activeContext describes: anAnnotationUser\r\rSubclasses can provide extra conditions for active annotations. In that case they override this method:\r\r\tMySpecialAnnotation>>isActiveInContext: anAnnotationUser\r\t\t^(super isActiveInContext: anAnnotationUser)\r\t\t\tand: [annotatingClass canBeUsedInContext: anAnnotationUser]\r\rSo the logic can depends on annotating class itself and actual annotation user.\r\rFor some scenarios you may need to query annotations according to original \"active\" definition despite of extra conditions.\rFor such cases I introduced the \"visibility\" of annotations: the annotation is visible if it is declared for given user:\r\r\tClassAnnotation>>isVisibleInContext: anAnnotationUser\r\t\t^activeContext describes: anAnnotationUser\r\rSo the visible annotation is not necessary active. But active annotation is always visible for given user:\r\r\tClassAnnotation>>isActiveInContext: anAnnotationUser\r\t\t^self isVisibleInContext: anAnnotationUser\r\r(I showed another version above to simplify description).\rThere are extra query methods to retrieve visible annotations:\r\r\tMySpecialAnnotation visibleInstancesInContext: anAnnotationUser.\r\tMySpecialAnnotation visibleInstancesInContext: anAnnotationUser do: [:ann | ].\r\tMySpecialAnnotation visibleInstancesFor: MyClass inContext: anAnnotationUser do: [:ann | ].\r\r-----------Advanced features. Annotation dependency methods------------\r\rIt is possible to call other methods inside annotation declaring methods (with pragma <classAnnotation>).\rSuch methods are dependency methods and their modification requires updating annotation cache (registry).\rYou can do it manually using\r\r\tClassAnnotation resetAll\r\t\rOr you can mark such methods with special pragma <classAnnotationDependency> and systen will track these methods for automatically.\t\rFor example in Commander package there is CmdShortcutCommandActivation annotation. It provides reusable methods for rename and remove shorcuts: cmd+r and cmd+x. So you can annotate commands using: \r\r\tMyRenameCommand class>>shortcutActivation\r\t\t<classAnnotation>\r\t\t^CmdShortcutCommandActivation renamingFor: MyApp.\r\rThis annotation will keep cmd+r in instance variable. \rIf you will modify #renamingFor: method with new shorctut the annotations should be updated. And special pragma ensures this logic:\r\r\tCmdShortcutCommandActivation class>>renamingFor: anAnnotationUser\r\t\t<classAnnotationDependency>\r\t\t^self by: $r meta for: anAnnotationUser \r\r-----------Advanced features. Redefining registered instances------------\r\rAll annotations are collected from methods and cached in default ClassAnnotationRegistry instance. \rI provide special mechanizm to redefine collected instances. When cache is updated I use and keep all redefined annotations.\r\rTo redefine particular annotation use #redefineBy: message with block which sets custom properties to original instance.\rFor example following code allows to redefine shortcut of #browse command in Calypso: \r\r\t(ClySpawnFullBrowserCommand classAnnotationsAt: #browserShortcutActivation)\r\t\tredefineBy: [:shortcut | shortcut keyCombination: $o meta ].\r\t\rTry evaluate it and press cmd+o on selected item in browser. If will open new browser window.\rYou can notice that old shortcut cmd+b is not working anymore.\r\rNow you can manualy reset annotation cache to check that it will not affect redefined shortcut: \r\r\tClassAnnotation resetCache.\r\t\rTo inspect redefined annotations ask their class for: \r\r\tCmdShortcutCommandActivation redefinedInstances\r\t\rRedefined instances are stored in class side variable #redefinedInstances. \rIt is a dictionary which keys are new redefining annotations and values are original annotations collected from methods.\rNotice that key and value are equal objects because annotations define equality using annotated class and declaration selector.\rSo dictionary items can be accessed using both objects.\r\rTo check that annotation is redefined use following example: \r\r\t (ClySpawnFullBrowserCommand classAnnotationsAt: #browserShortcutActivation)\r\t\t\tisRedefined\r\rAnd you can ask actual redefined annotaion: \r\r\t (ClySpawnFullBrowserCommand classAnnotationsAt: #browserShortcutActivation)\r\t\t\tredefinedInstance\r\t\t\rUsing annotation instance you can also retrieve redefining instance: \r\r\tanAnnotation redefiningInstance.\r\t\rIt should be identical to cached one.\r\t\rTo revert redefined annotation use #revertRedefinedInstance message: \r\r\t(ClySpawnFullBrowserCommand classAnnotationsAt: #browserShortcutActivation)\r\t\t\trevertRedefinedInstance\r\rCheck that now browse command is again activated by cmd+b shortcut (which is defined in annotation declaration method).\r\rTo revert all annotations use following script: \r\r\tCmdShortcutCommandActivation revertRedefinedInstances\r\rRedefining logic is very suitable mehanizm to override system behavior which depends on annotations without changing the code.\rIt can be used to manage particular kind of annotation in settings browser. \rFor example shortcut annotations based on Commander are available in setting browser. Users can explore and edit all shortcuts in the system. And these settings are persistable.\r\r-----------Internal Representation and Key Implementation Points------------\r \r    Instance Variables\r\tannotatedClass:\t\t<Class>\r\tdeclarationSelector:\t\t<Symbol>\r\tpriority:\t\t<Number>\r\tactiveContext:\t\t<AnnotationContext>","superclass":"Object","subclasses":["BrokenClassAnnotation","ForbiddenClassAnnotation","CmdCommandActivationStrategy","ClassAnnotationExample1","ClassAnnotationExample2","ClassAnnotationExample3","ClassAnnotationExampleWithFailedForbiddenCheck","ClassAnnotationExampleWithPriority","ClassAnnotationUnusedExample","ContextualClassAnnotationExample1","ContextualClassAnnotationExample2","ForbiddenClassAnnotationExample","ClyInheritedScopeProvider","ClyMethodVisibilityProvider","ClyContextSelectionStrategy","ClyTabActivationStrategy","ClyTableDecorationStrategy"],"name":"ClassAnnotation"},{"package":"ClassAnnotation-Tests","depth":4,"comment":"Please comment me using the following template inspired by Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) design:\r\rFor the Class part:  State a one line summary.

While ClyClassSideScope see only class side methods.\rOr ClySuperclassScope can access methods of all superclasses of basis classes. \r\rClass scope instances should be created on set of classes:\r\r\tClyClassScope of: String .\r\tClyClassScope ofAll: { String. Array }.\r\rI define accessing interface with following set of methods: \r\r- classesDo: aBlock \rEach scope should implement visible classes enumeration\r\r- methodsDo: aBlock\rEach scope should implement visible methodes enumeration\r\r- instanceVariablesDo: aBlock\rIt enumerates all instance variables available from visible classes. It is not abstract method. It is based of class enumeration.\r\r- classVariablesDo: aBlock\rIt enumerates all class variables available from visible classes. It is not abstract method. It is based of class enumeration.\r\r- variablesDo: aBlock\rIt enumerates all available variables from visible classes. It is not abstract.\r\r- methodGroupsDo: aBlock \rIt is special method which collects and enumerates all methods groups available for given class scope using environment plugins. The actual logic of groups colletion is explained in ClyAllMethodGroups comment.\r\r- collectAllClasses\r\r- includesClass: aClass\r\rThe methods enumeration is abstract because I do not apply any restriction on the visible meta level of classes.  \rSo for given class I do not know what methods I can access: instance side or class side, or both. \rIt is responsibility of my subclasses to define concrete meta level logic and implement #methodsDo: according to it. \rSo to define meta level logic subclasses should implement following methods:\r\r- metaLevelsOf: aClass do: aBlock\rIt should evaluate given aBlock with all meta levels of given class which are accessible from receiver. For example ClyInstanceSideScope will evaluate aBlock with instance side of aClass. And ClyBothMetaLevelClassScope will evaluate aBlock twice with instance side and class side separately.\r\r- localScopeClass \rIt should return one of ClyLocalClassScope subclasses depending on what local scope the receiver represents.\r\r- asLocalClassScope \rIt should convert the receiver to it local scope.\r\r- withMetaLevel: aMetaLevelScopeClass\rIt should convert the receiver to the similar scope but which will represent given meta level. Local scopes are converted completaly to new scope class with this method.\r\r- adoptLocalScopeClassTo: aLocalScopeClass\rIt should adopt receiver to the given local scope. As opposite to the previous method it supposed to modify receiver.\rIt is internal method to support #asScope: convertion propertly. Idea that converted class scope should keep receiver local scope if possible. And local scope itself implement this method with empty body.\r\rAnd I provide several convertion methods whichare used by tools to increase or decrease class and methods visibility:\r\r- asInheritedScope\rIt return the scope based on receiver basis which provide view on all inherited classes by any definition of inheritance availably in the system. It uses class annotation ClyInheritedScopeProvider to find actual scope class which is responsible to build inheritance scope from receiver. By default it is ClySuperclassScope which includes all superclasses of basis. But with Traits plugin it will be composed scope which includes superclasses and inherited traits. \r\r- increasedByClassesFrom: aClassScope \rIt returned similar scope to receiver but with basis increased by all classes visible from given aClassScope. \r \r- reducedByClassesFrom: aClassScope\rIt returned similar scope to receiver but with basis reduced by all classes visible from given aClassScope.\r\r- asInterestingClassScope\rThis methods was introduced specifically to be able restrict ClySuperclassScope by excluding too common superclasses like Object and ProtoObject. For this purpose the ClyInterestingSuperclassScope was implemented. \rThis method is also implemented in ClyCompositeScope. So in case when you have full class hierarchy composition scope you are also able restrict it by excluding uninteresting parts like Object.\rIt is used by browser to enable visibility of all inherited methods accept methods from most common classes like Object and ProtoObject.\r\rAlso I implement methods which are used in system changes processing.

But in another case position of same class will be different and depth could be not zero.\r\t\rProperties are represented by first class objects: subclasses of ClyProperty. To add and access them use following messages:\r\t- addProperty: aProperty\r\t- getProperty: aPropertyClass\r\t- getProperty: aPropertyClass ifAbsent: aBlock\r\t- hasProperty: aPropertyClass\r\rThere are special kind of properties for specific purposes:\r\rThere is hierarchy of item tags represented by subclasses of ClySimpleTag. They allow mark object with specific tag. For example there is ClyAbstractItemTag which is used to mark abstract classes and methods.\rYou can use following methods to manage tags:\r\t- markWith: aSimpleTagClass\r\t- isMarkedWith: aSimpleTagClass. It is analogue to #hasProperty:\r\rThere is special property ClyItemChildrenTag to mark object that it includes particilar kind of children. Kind of children is represented by class of children type.\rFor example you can mark class with methods:\r\tclassItem markWithChildrenOf: ClyMethod.\rTo check that object has particular children use:\r\tclassItem hasChildrenOf: ClyMethod\r\rAnother special kind of property is ClyItemLocalHierarchyProperty. It includes number of all local children which exists in item query result. \rFor example if you look at classes as a hierarchy then you can see Object and its subclasses. This hierarchy can be limited by package scope.\rSo in case of one particular package Object can have 10 subclasses. But in another package it can be 30 (for example).\rAnd ClyItemLocalHierarchyProperty represents such local hierarchy size. To access it use following methods:\r\t- localHierarchySize\r\t- localHierarchySize: count\rClyItemLocalHierarchyProperty is used by tools to organize tree view for list of items which provide local hierarchy by themselves. Item has no real list of children. But instead it knows count of internal tree. It allows tool hide right number of items when given parent node needs to be collapsed. Important condition here is that property must hold count of full subtree of local hierarchy (not just first level children).\r\rI collect properties using environment plugins. Query result prepares own browser items lazely when they should be returned to the user:\r\r\taBrowserItem prepareIn: environment\r\rBut actual preparation is delegated to plugins:\r\r\tenvironment pluginsDo: [ :each | aBrowserItem decorateBy: each].\r\rSo every plugin decorates item with properties. At the end decoration is dispatched to the item type which sends concrete typed message back to the plugin. \rFor example method decoration is evaluated to:\r\r\taPlugin decorateBrowserItem: aBrowserItem ofMethod: aBrowserItem actualObject.\r\t\rProperties computation can be heavy process and I use special flag #isPrepared to collect them only once.\r\rTo create my instances there is class side method:\r\r\tClyBrowserItem named: aString with: anObject\r\rBut normally you should ask anObject directly: \r\t\r\tanObject asCalypsoBrowserItem\r\rDuring instance creation I collect the type of given object:\r\r\tanObject calypsoEnvironmentType \r\rThe idea behind item type is to separate it from object class to not depends on single implementation of particular kind of objects. For example there is CompiledMethod, RGMethodDefinition and RG2MethodDefinition. They all represent different model of methods. But for the browser it is important to work with them in same way. So all of them return ClyMethod class as calypsoEnvironmentType. It allows avoid duplication of methods by delegating actual logic to the reusable item type class. \rFor example system browser defines commands to be used in context of selected methods. It uses ClyMethod type to attach commands to methods. And they available and work independently from concrete method class. \rBut by default the calypso type is the class of object. And it is not necessery to introduce separate type for every kind of item.\r\rI provide several methods to compare items: \r\r- isSameAs: anotherBrowserItem\rIt checks that receiver and argument represent same actual object. The #same meaning is based on item type to which I delegate actual comparison:\r\r\ttype checkCalypsoItem: actualObject isSameAs: anotherBrowserItem actualObject\r\r- isEqualTo: anotherBrowserItem \rIt checks that receiver and argument represent equal actual objects. The #equal meaning is based on item type to which I delegate actual comparison:\r\ttype checkCalypsoItem: actualObject isEqualTo: anotherBrowserItem actualObject\r\r- isSimilarTo: anotherBrowserItem\rIt is very weak comparison which return true for two equaly named items of same type. If they are named differently then isEqualTo: comparison will be result.\rThe method is used in browser logic to restore desired selection. For example when user selects new class which has the method similar to the prevous method selection of another class.\r\rAs you see comparison logic is also delegated to the item type. So in method example all method implementations do not need to duplicate them.\r\rThere are few other testing methods:\r\r- representsItemOfType: itemType\rIt check that browser item belongs to the given type. It uses #includesBehaviour: logic.\r\r- representsObject: anObject\rIt checks that browser item represents same object as argument.

This reflects the flow of navigation: selection in the left panel leads to the new content at the right panel.\r\r!! Example of Queries \r\rI create query instances using current state like selections, metalevel scope (class/inst side) and current queries themselves. \rIn some cases it is quite complex logic and it requires interaction between different objects. For exampe the construction logic of methodGroupQuery is very complex:\r\t- the different query class for variable mode (vars in protocols pane)\r\t- in variable mode the scope is different (vars are shown from all superclasses)\r\t- extra query composition when query is build from scope of extended classes (grey classes are selected)\r\t- extra logic to allow default traits visibility\r\t- some other details.\r(it could be extracted to new kind of queries and scopes)\r\r!! Browser Logic \rAnother part of browser logic is defined in methods like #selectMethod:, #selectClass:, selectPackage:. A browser knows that to select method it should first select its class. To select class it should first select its package. In some cases it is also not trivial logic. Look at selectClass: method. \r\rIdeally browser should be a model itself independently from UI.  But this point deserves another iteration. The main concern of the current version was to introduce queries to manage browser state. It simplifies a lot of behaviour but it still not enough to get really clean solution. \r\r\r!! Browser contexts \r\rBrowser contexts are not for maintaining the state. They only represent possible state of components. They are approach to have pluggability points for commands, tabs, toolbars and table decorators. Remember that commands are annotated with activators for particular context where they should be used. Exactly the same logic is used for other parts of browser. Everything you read in Commander chapter is applicable for tabs, table decorators and toolbar items. Tabs are annotated with ClyTabActivationStrategy. Table decorators are annotated with ClyTableDecorationStrategy.\r\rSo a browser collects contexts from children because otherwise children will need to know about toolbar and tabs. Now they only know the browser. Also all contexts are used to build spotter command menu (cmd+/). Query views has no information about it.  \r\r\r!! Browser changes \r\rI implement logic how and when rebuild tabs and toolbar. Any browser change should be wrapped by method #changeStateBy:\r\r\tbrowser changeStateBy: [ packageView selection selectItemsWith: { 'Kernel' asPackage } ]\r\t\rAny selection change can lead to the changes in all related navigation views which follow navigation flow. I ensure in this method that tabs and toolbar will be rebuilt only when navigation will be completely finished. However this is only when all views will set new content and selection that I will update tabs and toolbar.\r\rAlso I manage navigation history by allowing go back and forward in the browser. And this method also ensures that intermediate navigation states will not be considered as navigation. Many selection changes can be triggered from single #changeStateBy: call. But I will add only one item to the history.\r\rI provide two methods to force go back and forward navigation: \r\r\tbrowser navigateBack.\r\tbrowser navigateForward.\r\rFor more details on history implementation look at ClyNavigationHistory.\r\r\r\r\r\r!! How to create new browsers\r\r\rSubclasses should implement #initializeNavigationViews to configure the number of navigation panes and their properties.\rThey should create navigation views using #newNavigationView message: \r\r\tpackageView := self newNavigationView.\r\t\rThe content of view should be set in another methods (see bellow). During initialization you should only configure structure of the view.\rFor example by default created view will show single column with the name of item.\rBut you can configure different label using following method: \r\r\tpackageView mainColumn \r\t\tdisplayItemPropertyBy: [:packageItem | packageItem name, packageItem actualObject classes size asString].\r\r(the argument of the block is instance of ClyDataSourceItem which wrap actual object retrieved by query).\r\rAlso to describe navigation flow you should setup selector which should called when user will select any item: \r\t\r\tpackageView requestNavigationBy: #packageSelectionChanged.\r\t \rLook at ClyQueryView(Morph) to find more possible settings and browser senders of #newNavigationView (for example you can add more columns to the view).\r\rTo setup the content of the navigation views you should implement method #prepareInitialState. For the package view example it can be: \r\r\tpackages := ClyAllPackages sortedFrom: self systemScope.\r\tpackageView showQuery: packages \r\rYou do not need to set up the content of all navigation views. They have kind of empty data source by default.\rDuring navigation you will configure them in the navigation request methods.

Instead if ask the tool to indicate different browser context.\rTo support this logic tools should implement following methods: \r\r- belongsToCurrentBrowserContext\rFor example method editor checks that browser still selects editing method.\r\r- warnUserAboutMyContext\rHere the tool is supposed to reset any indication of different context. It happens when user move selection back where dirty tab should be opened again. \r\r- warnUserAboutDifferentContext\rHere the tool can indicate that it is now is untouched from the current browser state. For example when user selects new method while dirty method is still opened. \r\r- warnUserAboutChangedContext\rIt just merges previous two methods by testing for #belongsToCurrentBrowserContext.\r\rTo support dirty state subclasses should implement method #hasUnacceptedEdits. It is false by default.\rAnd indication of dirtiness can be overridden in the method #updateDirtyState. By default it just adds * to the tab title. \r\r- hasUnacceptedEdits (false by default)\r- updateDirtyState\r\rSo tabs are based on some models. For example method editor model is a method. \rWhen tool model is removed from system (method is removed) the tab should be automatically closed.\rTab manager detects such conditions using following method which tools should implement:\r\r- belongsToRemovedBrowserContext\r\rFor example method editor checks that editing method was removed from system.\r\rSo the model of the tool can be modified and therefore the tool should implement update logic using following methods:\r\r- attachToSystem\rIt should subscribe the tool for model changes.\r\r- detachFromSystem\rIt should unsubscribe the tool from the model.\r\rIn addition I provide method #update which subclasses should reuse in the update logic of the method changes.\r#update refreshes basic visual properties of tool retrieved from the model and it rebuilds status bar.\r\rTabManager orders retrieved tools using method #tabOrder.\rAlso manager chooses what tab should be selected first.

Any plugin can compute specific properties for given item. \rFor example plugin can mark class that it is abstract:\r\t\r\tMyPluginClass>>decorateBrowserItem: anItem ofClass: aClass\r\t\taClass isAbstract ifTrue: [ anItem markWith: ClyAbstractItemTag  ]\r\t\t\rConcrete decoration methods which plugin can implement are depends on the item types which plugin is going support. For another example to decorate methods plugin should implement: \r\r- decorateBrowserItem: anItem ofMethod: aMethod\r\rNormally when you develop navigation over concrete system you build some common superclass plugin which will provide stubs for all item types form your domain. \rIn case of Smalltalk navigation there is ClySystemEnvironmentPlugin which implements empty methods to decorate packages, classes and methods (like in examples)\r\r2) Connect external systems to the navigation environment. \rPlugin package can provide new kind of queries and scopes which retrieves new kind of items. These items can be from systems which are external to the main navigation environment. \rPlugin should take care about external updates by subscribing to external system for the changes and by delegating them to the navigation environment.\r\rFor example SUnit plugin extends Smalltalk environment with information about tests. It subscribes on SUnit events about test ran. And when it happens it delegates event to the environment which updates methods queries with new information about test result.\r\rTo connect to external system plugin implements following method:\r- attatchToSystem \rHere plugin can subscribe on external events. For example SUnit plugin subscribes on \"TestCase historyAnnouncer\" to know when user run tests.\r\rAnd to disconnect from system should implement:\r- detatchFromSystem\rFor example SUnit plugin unsubscribes from \"TestCase historyAnnouncer\".\r\r3) Collect query result metadata. \rFor example SUnit plugin can collect how many success tests are retrieved by method query.\rThe exact methods which plugin should implement depends on the kind of queries it is supposed to support. In case of SUnit it implements:\r- collectMetadataOfMethods: aQueryResult\r\rBut decision what method to use is responsibility of queries. For example: \r\r\tClyMethodQuery>>collectMetadataOf: aQueryResult by: anEnvironmentPlugin\r\t\tanEnvironmentPlugin collectMetadataOfMethods: aQueryResult\r\rAs in case of items decoration the superclass of plugins can provide empty methods for metadata collection. So concrete plugin only chooses what it wants.\r\rThat is all responsibility.\r \rTo activate plugin it should be added to navigation environment: \r\tenvironment addPlugin: anEnvironmentPlugin \r\rDefault global environment adds all plugins automatically.

It should be returned from method #asGlobalScopeIn: which system should implement.\rUsers can access the system and it scope from my instance:\r\t\r\tenvironment system\r\tenvironment systemScope\r\r2) The system should notify my instance about changes.\rI maintain query cache and it requires invalidation when system is changed. So responsibility of any system is to subscribe and unsubscribe my instances for possible changes: \r\t\r\taSystem subscribe: environment\r\taSystem unsubscribe: environment\r\t\rI am subscribed when I am attaching to the system:\r\t\r\tenvironment attachToSystem\r\t\rAnd I am unsubscribed when detaching: \r\r\tenvironment detachFromSystem\r\t\rUser should manually attach my instances to the system when they are interested in updates.\r\rI should not be subclassed. \r\rUsers can maintain singleton instance of me for concrete system. It will provide global cache for all queries over given system.\rFor this purpose I provide class side variable defaultGlobalEnvironments. It maps system instance to my instance (aNavigationEnvironment) over it.\rIdea that applications usually have kind of default system instance (imaging Smalltalk global). And to provide default navigation over it users can extend my class side with appropriate accessing method. \rFor example navigation over current Smalltalk image is accessed using #currentImage method: \r\r\tClyNavigationEnvironment class>>currentImage \t\r\t\t^self defaultOver: ClySystemEnvironment currentImage\r\rThe method #defaultOver: retrieves existing instance or creates new one. Such default instances are automatically attached to the system.\rIn this example the system is an instance of ClySystemEnvironment which represents Smalltalk system. (it was suitable to introduce extra wrapper for this domain. Look it comment for details).\r\rTo reset all global environments send #reset message to me: \r\r\tClyNavigationEnvironment reset\r\t\rIt will detach (unsubscribe) environments from their systems and clear collection.\r\rI provide #query: method to execute queries using cache. But userrs should not use it directly.\rUsers should prepare scope instance using given environment:\r\r\tscope := ClyClassScope of: Object in: environment \r\rAnd then create and execute query instance: \r\r\tquery := ClyAllMethods from: scope.\r\tquery execute\r\rUnderhood my #query: method is called by scope during query execution logic. I returns existing result if it exists. Otherwise I build new one.\r\rThere is another method which allow to check that given query will produce empty result:\r\t\r\tenvironment isQueryEmpty: query\r\t\rIt also should not be used directly. But query should be asked directly: \r\r\tquery hasEmptyResult\r\rIf there is existing result then I just check that it is not empty. Otherwise I ask query to #checkEmptyResult where it evaluates actual logic.\r\rTo maintain query cache I use two mutexes:\r\r- accessGuard, protects any modification of queryCache\r- updateGuard, protects cache updating in the way that multiple changes will be always processed in sequence\r\rIn my cache the query is a key and the result is a value. The cache is weak and unused result is cleaned by GC. In same time unused keys (queries which result is cleaned) are collected when new query is executed (using #cleanGarbageInCache).\r\rI am extendable by plugins, subclasses of ClyEnvironmentPlugin. Plugins are responsible to extend queries of particular system in following ways:\r\r- plugin can extend properties of query result (ClyBrowserItem instances and query metadata).\r- plugin can supply information about other systems. \rPlugins are packaged separatelly. Plugin package can extend visibility of existing scopes by providing new information from external systems. This information can be retrieved by new queries.\rAnd to manage this information plugin should notify environment about external changes.\r\rTo add plugin use following method:\r\r\tenvironment addPlugin: MyTestPlugin new.\r\t\rAnd to access plugins use: \r\t\r\tenvironment pluginsDo: aBlock\r\t\rWhen I am attached to the system I also attach all my plugins to it using:\r\r\tplugin attachToSystem\r\rIn this method plugin is able to subscribe on own system changes to notify environment about them.\r \rInternal Representation and Key Implementation Points.\r\r    Instance Variables \r\tplugins:\t\t<Collection of<ClyEnvironmentPlugin>>>\r\tqueryCache:\t\t<WeakValueDictionary of<ClyQuery, ClyQueryResult>>\r\tsystem: \t<Object>\r\tupdateStrategy:\t<ClyEnvironmentUpdateStrategy>\r\tupdateGuard:\t<Mutex>\r\taccessGuard:\t<Mutex>","superclass":"Object","subclasses":[],"name":"ClyNavigationEnvironment"},{"package":"Calypso-NavigationModel-Tests","depth":6,"comment":"Please comment me using the following template inspired by Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) design:\r\rFor the Class part:  State a one line summary.

For example to query Smalltalk image there is global #currentImage environment: \r\r\tscope := ClyClassScope of: Object in: ClyNavigationEnvironment currentImage.\r\t\rWhen query instance is created you can simply execute it: \r\r\tresult := query execute.\r\t\rThe result of any query is a kind of ClyQueryResult.\rBy default it is always ClyRawQueryResult which do not apply any formatting or transformation on retrieved items.\rThe required result is a parameter of any query, the variable #requiredResult. Responsibility of result is to format or transform items retrieved by query. \rFor example there are ClySortedQueryResult which sort items using given sort funciton.\r\rThe value of requiredResult variable is used as prototype to create actual result instances. During execution the query creates it using: \r\r\tactualResult := requiredResult prepareNewFor: aQuery in: environment\r\t\rYou can specify requird result when you create query instances. For example: \r\r\tClyAllClassQuery from: packageScope as: ClySubclassHierarchy new asQueryResult.\r\t\rMy subclasses provide various constructors to specify such parameters.\r\t\rAny query instance can be converted to query with new required result: \r\r\taQuery withResult: ClySpecialQueryResult new\r\t\rThere are other converting methods which are supported by any kind of queries: \r\r- withScope: aScope, it returnes similar query but with different scope\r- withScopeOf: newBasisObjects, it returns similar query with scope of different basis\r- restrictedByScope: aScope, it returnes similar query with similar scope restricted by basis of given scope.\r- filtereBy: anItemFilter, it returns wrapper query which filters original query result using given filter\r\rMy subclasses must implement several methods: \r\t\r- buildResult: aQueryResult \rIt is the method where query retrieves items from the scope and fill given result with them. Look at implementors.\r\r- checkEmptyResult\rIt checks that result will be empty without full execution.\r\r-isResult: aQueryResult affectedBy: aSystemAnnouncement\rAny query can be affected by system changes. Subclasses should decide what changes can affect them.\r\r- retrivesItem: anObject\rSubclasses should check that given item can be retrieved. This check should not depends on query scope.\r\r- retrivesItemOfType: aClass\rSubclasses should check what kind of items they retrieve.\r\r- executesQuery: aTypedQueryClass\rSubclasses should check that they in fact executes given query class. For example composite query will ask subqueries for this question. But typed queries will use simple isKindOf: check.\r\r- withScope: aScope \rSubclasses should implement converting to the similar query from new given scope.\r\r- withScopeOf: newBasisObjects \rSubclasses should implement converting to the similar query from the similar scope of new given basis.\r \r- #unionWith: typedQueries as: aQueryResult\rSubclasses should implement converting to composite query union given collection of subqueries.\r\r- #, anotherQuery \rSubclasses should implement union with another query.\r\r-collectMetadataOf: aQueryResult by: anEnvironmentPlugin\rSubclasses should dispatch metadata collection to the given environment plugin.\r\rAlso there is special ClyUnionQuery class which requires additional method to be implemented: \r\r- mergeOwnInstances: queries\rIt should merge similar query instances. Idea to reduce subqueries count in union query. Subclasses should produce single query with merged collection of parameters. The argument is always collection of receiver instances.\r\rQueries should define user friendly #description. I provide very general implementation based on class name. Look at implementors for examples.\r\rNavigation environment caches my instances and their results. It requires correct implementation of equality and hashing.\rSome queries include various state which can be initialized at different time. It is important that instance will be not modified after execution because instead it can affect hash and equality functions which are used by cache. \rFor this reason I implement special method #fixStateBeforeExecution which marks the instance and related state (the scope for example) as read only objects (#beReadOnlyObject). So after execution my instances became immutable.\r\rAnd according to this logic I provide special hook #prepareStateBeforeExecution to prepare complete state of query instance before execution. It allows initialize lazy variables before making instance immutable.\r\t\t\t\rThe Calypso-Browser package provide UI widget to browse query results.

They should implement method:\r\r- fillWith: items \r\rAny query has special parameter #requiredResult which specifies what kind of result should represent retrieved items. It is an instance of result which is used as prototype to create actual result instances. \r\rWhen query is executed at first time the navigation environment prepares new instance of required result:\r\t\r\tactualResult := aQuery prepareNewResult.\r\rwhere query asks #requiredResult for: \r\r\tactualResult := requiredResult prepareNewFor: aQuery in: environment\r\rThen actualResult is cached using query as a key. And subsequent query execution just returns existing value.\r\rThus my instances describe required result and they can be implemented using composition of other objects. So different instances of same result class can lead to different result of query.\rFor example there is ClySortedQueryResult with #sortFunction variable. It allows to sort retrieved items using different criteria and different direction (ascending or descending).\r\rSince requiredResult is part of query it is used in query comparison and hashing logic. And therefore my subclasses should correctly implement equality and hash operations when they introduce new parameters.\rAlso instances which are used as required result should be immutable because instead modification of result can corrupt cache of queries. \rTo ensure this property #requiredResult is marked as readOnlyObject when it is assigned to the query.\r\rActual query execution is initiated by me using method #rebuildIfNeeded. Navigation environment calls it before returning result to the user.\r\rI maintain special flag #needsRebuild to detect that existing items are dirty or are not built yet. So at first time #rebuildIfNeeded will lead to actual query execution (result building). But then it will do nothing until update will be not requested again.\r\rSo #rebuildIfNeeded will call #rebuild which will ask #buildingQuery to build result: \r\r\taQuery buildResult: self \r\rAt the end aQuery fills result instance with items retrieved from the scope of environment.\r\rNotice that #rebuild itself is private method. Users should use #rebuildIfNeeded. In fact users do not need it too because it is lazely evaluated when my items are accessed. But in case when query is executed it is evaluated explicitly by navigation environment. So callers always receive fresh result.\r\rIn the case when you want force items update there are two methods: \r\r- forceRebuild \rIt set flag #needsRebuild to true and notify observers about changes (observers will be explained below).\r\r- forceLazyRebuild \rIt silently set flag #needsRebuild to true without any notification to observers.\r\rIn first case observers can handle notification by requesting new items from the result instance.\rFor example if UI widget observes result items and shows them to the user the #forceRebuild message will update shown items immediately. \rBut #forceLazyRebuild will not update items until user request it manually.\rIn addition both methods reset items to nil.\r\rThere is extra helper method #cancelRebuild which reset rebuild flag and reset items to the empty collection.\r\rMy instances are safe to be used from multiple processes. Building and updating of items are protected by my #accessGuard mutex.\r\rI provide several methods to access built items: \r\r- itemsStartingAt: startIndex count: size\r\r- itemsStartingWhere: conditionBlock count: size\rIt finds first item where condition is true and then it returns \"size\" items starting from the found position\r\r- itemsWhere: conditionBlock\rIt collects all items where conditionBlock is true\r\r- allItems\r\r- size\r\r- isEmpty\r\rThese methods are safe to be used at any time: when user calls them I first ensure that items are ready and if not I rebuild them. \rAlso I protect these methods by #accessGuard mutex. So it is safe to access items from multiple processes.\rTo ensure this logic I use helper method #protectItemsWhile:.\r\rSo I am cached by navigation environment. And this cache requires updates when underlying system is changed.\rFor this purpose navigation environment subscribes on system changes. And when any change happens the environment asks every result in cache to handle given event object:\r\r\taQueryResult handleSystemChange: aSystemAnnouncement\r \rTo handle system change I ask my #buildingQuery if it is affected by given event. And if it is affected I force rebuild using #itemsChanged method where I announce that I was changed.\rI allow my users to be notified when my items are changed. Users should subscribe to me using #subscribe: method:\r\t\r\taQueryResult subscribe: anObserver \r\t\rUnderhood I subscribe anObserver for ClyEnvironmentChanged to my #announcer. And it will be notified using #itemsChanged message. So observers should implement this method.\rAlso observers must #unsubscribe: when they are not interested anymore. \r\rFor the UI support I provide special stream kind access in the form of ClyBrowserQueryCursor instance which returns items as ClyBrowserItem instances.\rClyBrowserItem is a wrapper over actual result item which provides UI specific information like position in the result, depth in the hierarchy and extendable set of properties related to the underlying object.\rTo get cursor instance you should open it for concrete observer:\r\r\tcursor := aQueryResult openBrowserCursorFor: anObserver\r\ranObserver will be subscribed on my changes and new cursor instance will be returned to the caller.\rWhen cursor is not needed anymore it should be closed. It will unsubscribe observer in addition:\r\r\tcursor close\r\rWith cursor you are able access items as ClyBrowserItem instances. For example: \r\r\tcursor currentItem.\r\tcursor moveToNext.\r\tcursor findItemsWhere: conditionBlock \r\t\rThe important responsibility of cursor is to organize cache of retrieved browser items. It is especially important for remote scenario where cache represents loaded remote items. But also it caches all extended properties collected for items by environment plugins.  \r\rSo cursor expects instances of ClyBrowserItem from inderlying query result. \rSome my subclasses build them directly from retrieved raw items. They are subclasses of ClyBrowseQueryResult. They provide extra query methods to lookup browser items.\rWhen cursor is requested for such result it is just created over receiver instance.\rBut other result classes can't be used directly in cursor because they have no knowledge about browser items. For example ClyRawQueryResult just returns raw objects which were retrieved by query.\rFor such cases I provide special adapter ClyQueryResultBrowserAdapter: by default cursor instance is always created over adapter which wraps actual result instance.\rAdapter converts actual items to the ClyBrowserItem instances and implements same query methods as ClyBrowserQueryResult.\rThis logic is implemented in method #adoptForBrowser which is overridden by ClyBrowserQueryResult with self return.\r\rFor more details about cursor look at ClyBrowserQueryCursor comments. And read comments of ClyBrowserItem.\r\rThe last feature which I provide for my subclasses is metadata. I compute it lazily on demand and keed it in the #metadata variable. Metadata is updated together with items. So when items are changed the metadata is reset and subsequent call for it will recompute it again.\rThe metadata is an instance of ClyQueryResultMetadata which represents extended properties of result in general. For example the result of class query can include the count of success tests as metadata property.\rProperties are represented by first class objects, a kind of ClyProperty.\rThe metadata is collected using environment plugins. So it is extended by them. \rPlugins collect information of concrete type of result items. For example: \r\t\r\t\tplugin collectMetadataOfClasses: aQueryResult\r\t\tplugin collectMetadataOfMethods: aQueryResult\r\t\t\rThe decision what method to use is responsibility of #buildingQuery which knows what kind of items it retrieves:\r\r\tmetadata := ClyQueryResultMetadata new.\r\tenvironment pluginsDo: [:each | \r\t\tbuildingQuery collectMetadataOf: self by: each\t]\r\rSo every query class should implement the method #collectMetadataOf:by:.\r\rTo access metadata there are several methods:\r\r- addMetaProperty: aProperty\r- getMetaProperty: aPropertyClass\r- hasMetaProperty: aPropertyClass\t\r- metadata\r\rSame protocol is also implemented in ClyBrowserQueryCursor.

This methods are supposed to be in form of enumeration based on block:\r\taScope someKindOfObjectsDo: aBlockWithObjectArg\rFor example ClyPackageScope shows objects which are visible from given packages: packages, classes and methods. And to access them it implements following methods:\r- packagesDo:\r- classesDo:\r- methodsDo:\r\rScope instances are always created in some environment and based on set of basis objects. Basis objects are the root of information which scope can provide for queries.\rScopes which are based on single type objects are represented by subclasses of ClyTypedScope. They provide instance creation methods:\r\r\tscope := ClyPackageScope of: 'Kernel' asPackage in: ClyNavigationEnvironment currentImage.\r\tscope := ClyPackageScope ofAll: {'Kernel' asPackage. 'Alien' asPackage} in: ClyNavigationEnvironment currentImage.\r\rFor more information read ClyTypedScope comment.\rI do not provide any constructor because I do not know how concrete scope will be created, how it will setup the basis.\rBut I provide set of operation to convert any scope to the given typed scope class:\r- asScope: aTypedScopeClass. It creates instance of given scope class using receiver basis and environment.\r- asScope: aTypedScopeClass of: singleBasisObject. It creates instance of given scope class using given singleBasisObject and receiver environment.\r- asScope: aTypedScopeClass ofAll: newBasisObjects. It creates instance of given scope class using given newBasisObjects and receiver environment.\rSo the main point of these methods is to create new scope instances with existing properties of given scope. Where environment is always shared. \r\rAlso I implement several testing methods which are used in some UI logic:\r- isBasedOn: aBasisObject\r- isBasedOnEmptyBasis\r- isBasedOnSingleBasis\r- isBasedOnMultipleBasis\r\rAlthough it is preferred to instantiate scopes in the environment in some cases it is conveinient to bound scope to the environment separately from instantiation. \rFor this purpose there are few methods:\r- isBoundToEnvironment\r- bindTo: aNavigationEnvironment\r\rScope is integral part of query. So it participates in environment query cache. And therefore any scope should correctly implement comparison: equal and hash operations. \rI provide default implementation based on basis objects. And subclasses which introduce extra parameters should provide specialized implementation.\rAlso it adds restriction that scope should be completaly initialized at query execution time and after it should never be modified. It is protected by write barrier logic when query fixes state before execution. It forces scope to beReadOnlyObject.\r\rTo support query execution I also provide several methods which are supposed to not be used externally:\r- query: aQuery\r- isQueryEmpty: aQuery\rThese methods are called by query. And I just delegate them to the environment.\rAlso subclasses should implement #adoptQuery: method to prepare given query for execution from receiver.\rFor example there is composite scope which converts given query to the composite query. Because simple query can't be executed directly from composite.\rAnd by same reason I require subclasses implement:\r- supportsQuery: aQuery\rQuery checks it when it is assigned to the scope. It allows to detect incompatibitily early and signal error.\r\rAlso in case of composite scope users can be still interested to know that they work with some simple scope which is part of composite. \rTo made such test independent of type of scope I require subclasses to implement:\r- representsScope: aScopeClass \rIn case of composte it will check subscopes. And in case of simple scope it will simply check isKindOf:.\r\rIn addition I provide printing infrastructure.\rSubclasses can define class side method #defaultName. And users can override it in instance:\r\taScope name: 'special name'  \rI implement #description with these names which is used in UI and to print queries:\r\taScope description\rIn addition basis objects are appended in the end of desription. \rSubclasses can specialize how basis objects are printed using method #printBasisObject:on:.\rFor printString logic I just print basis in brackets. \rLook at examples:\r\t(ClyPackageScope of: 'Kernel' asPackage) description \"==> 'packages: Kernel'\"\r\t(ClyPackageScope of: 'Kernel' asPackage) printString \"==>  'a ClyPackageScope(Kernel)'\"\r \rInternal Representation and Key Implementation Points.\r\r    Instance Variables\r\tbasisObjects:\t\t<Set>\r\tenvironment:\t\t<ClyNavigationEnvironment>\r\tname:\t\tString","superclass":"Object","subclasses":["ClyCompositeScope","ClyTypedScope","ClyUnknownScope"],"name":"ClyScope"},{"package":"Calypso-SystemTools-QueryBrowser","depth":5,"comment":"I am a tool to switch query browser to new choosen scope.\rI use compobox to allow user choose it.\r\rI am shown as first item in the browser toolbar.\r\rBy instances should be created on browser: \r\r\tClyScopeCompoBox for: ClyQueryBrowser.\r\t\rInternal Representation and Key Implementation Points.\r\r    Instance Variables\r\tbrowser:\t\t<ClyQueryBrowser>\r\tdropList:\t\t<Object>\r","superclass":"ClyBrowserToolbarItemMorph","subclasses":[],"name":"ClyScopeCompoBox"},{"package":"Calypso-NavigationModel-Tests","depth":5,"comment":"Please comment me using the following template inspired by Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) design:\r\rFor the Class part:  State a one line summary.

In that case such new tool will be not used. And existing tool will be not removed. So it will stay opened.\r\rI use #isSimilarTo: tab method to detect that new collected tool is already opened (the browser already shows similar tool).\rBy default #isSimilarTo: simply checks the class of given tool.

In examples above it is YourAppContext.\rTo be able to use commands application/tool should provide instance of current context to perform command lookup:\r\r\tCmdShortcutCommandActivation allAvailableInContext: aToolContext do: blockWithActivation\r\rIt enumerate all shortcut activation strategies which are declared for given aToolContext. \rFound activation can check if command can be executed in given context or not:\r\tregisteredActivation canExecuteCommandInContext: aToolContext\rwhich  delegates question to context and then to command:\r\taToolContext allowsExecutionOf: command\r\tcommand canBeExecutedInContext: aToolContext\rBy default It returns true. But my subclasses can implement it using specific information of given context.\rIt is important that this message is not taken into account in enumeration method. There are cases when users want all commands including the commands which could not be executed in current context. For example in context menu such commands can be disabled and it can be important to show them in special unclickable state. Currently all \"disabled\" commands are skipped during menu building. But it can be configurable in future versions.\r\rNext thing to do with found activation is to create new activator instance which is responsible for command execution in given context:\r\tcommandActivator := activationStrategy newActivatorFor: aToolContext\rCommand activator keeps information about activation context and it is able to execute command. It initializes command with the state relevant to the current context:\r\tcommand readParametersFromContext:  aToolContext \rBy default It is the empty method and usually commands not override it. There is another method to prepare full state of command just before execution (see below). And for simplicity commands usually implement only this.\rSome tools collect activators to represent commands to user. For example in context menu every item is based on activator. Using command instance it provides label and icon for the menu item. Commands provide default values for them which sometimes depend on internal command state. For such cases commands retrieve this state in advance from the given context instance in the method readParametersFromStandardContext:.\r\rCommand activator can execute the command:\r\tcommandActivator executeCommand\rIt performs three steps:\r1) Prepare command for execution.  Command should retrieve all state required for execution from given context. By default activator asks command using:\r\tcommand prepareFullExecutionInContext: aToolContext\rDuring preparation commands can ask user for extra data. \rI provide empty implementation for this method and my subclasses overrides it.\rCommands can signal CmdCommandAborted to break execution process. For example It happens when user cancel confirmation dialog during command preparation.\r\r2) Command execution. All logic is implemented by command in #execute method.\r\r3) Applying execution result to given context:\r\tcommand applyResultInContext: aToolContext \rIdea is to be able interract with application when command completes. For example if user creates new package from the browser then at the end the browser should  open created package.\r\rCommands are supposed to be reusable for different contexts and activators. And these methods should be implemented with that in mind. They should not discover internal structure of contexts.\r\rt is possible to override activation methods for specific contexts and send own set of messages to command. For example: \r\r\tSpecialContextA>>allowsExecutionOf: aCommand\r\t\t ^aCommand canBeExecutedInSpecialContextA: self\r\t\r\tSpecialContextA>>prepareFullExecutionOf: aCommand\r\t\t aCommand prepareFullExecutionInSpecialContextA: self\r\r\tSpecialContextA>>applyResultOf: aCommand\r\t\t aCommand applyResultInSpecialContextA: self\r\rBy default I can implement these extensions with standard context methods. And only particular subclasses will override them specifically:\r\r\tCmdCommand>>prepareFullExecutionInSpecialContextA: aSpecialContextA\r\t\t self prepareFullExecutionInContext: aSpecialContextA\r\r\tSomeCommand>>prepareFullExecutionInSpecialContextA: aSpecialContextA\r \t\t \"special logic to prepare command for execution\"\r\rBesides, specific command activation strategies can require own set of activation methods. For example CmdDragAndDropCommandActivator needs two contexts to prepare command. First context describes the place where drag was started. Last context describes drop target tool.  And for execution command should be prepared in both context. They bring different information and together they are supposed to provide all required data for command execution without extra user requests. \r\rDifferent activation strategies extends me with UI related messages. For example look at context menu activation. It asks me to build menu items:\r\tcommand fillContextMenu: aMenu using: anActivator\rBy default I just create standart item morph and allow subclasses to define default label and icon:\t\r- defaultMenuItemName\r- setUpIconForMenuItem: aMenuItemMorph\rBut subclasses can override build method and represent themselves more specifically. For example they can provide menu item with check box. You can see such cases in morph menu.\r\rThe way how concrete type of activation strategy hook into application is responsibility of application. For example to support shortcuts based on commands application should define specific kmDispatcher for target morphs:\r\tYourAppMorph>>kmDispatcher\r\t\t^ CmdKMDispatcher attachedTo: self\rwith supporting method:\r\tYourAppMorph>>createCommandContext\r\t\t^YourAppContext for: self\r\t\t\rIf application wants context menu based on commands then it needs to hook into context menu part of application and ask context menu activation to build menu:\r\tmenu := CmdContextMenuCommandActivator buildMenuFor: anAppMorph inContext: aToolContext\r\t\rIn future Commander will be deeply integrated in UI.

At the very last moment a Color is converted to a pixelValue that depends on the depth of the actual Bitmap inside the Form it will be used with.  The supported depths (in bits) are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32.  The number of actual colors at these depths are: 2, 4, 16, 256, 32768, and 16 million.  (See comment in BitBlt.)  To change the depth of the Display and set how many colors you can see, execute: (Display newDepth: 8).  (See comment in DisplayMedium)\r\r\tColor is represented as the amount of light in red, green, and blue.  White is (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) and black is (0, 0, 0).  Pure red is (1.0, 0, 0).  These colors are \"additive\".  Think of Color's instance variables as:\r\tr\tamount of red, a Float between 0.0 and 1.0.\r\tg\tamount of green, a Float between 0.0 and 1.0.\r\tb\tamount of blue, a Float between 0.0 and 1.0.\r(But, in fact, the three are encoded as values from 0 to 1023 and combined in a single integer, rgb.  The user does not need to know this.)\r\r\tMany colors are named.  You find a color by name by sending a message to class Color, for example (Color lightBlue).  Also, (Color red: 0.2 green: 0.6 blue: 1.0) or (Color r: 0.2 g: 0.6 b: 1.0) creates a color. (see below)\r\tA color is essentially immutable.  Once you set red, green, and blue, you cannot change them.  Instead, create a new Color and use it.\r\t\r\tApplications such as contour maps and bar graphs will want to display one of a set of shades based on a number.  Convert the range of this number to an integer from 1 to N.  Then call (Color green lightShades: N) to get an Array of colors from white to green.  Use the Array messages at:, atPin:, or atWrap: to pull out the correct color from the array.  atPin: gives the first (or last) color if the index is out of range.  atWrap: wraps around to the other end if the index is out of range.\r\t\t\rMessages:\r\tmixed: proportion with: aColor\tAnswer this color mixed with the given color additively.

Typically, one reserves one entry in the color map for transparent. This allows 1, 3, 15, or 255 non-transparent colors in ColorForms of depths 1, 2, 4, and 8 bits per pixel. ColorForms don't support depths greater than 8 bits because that would require excessively large color maps with little real benefit, since 16-bit and 32-bit depths already support thousands and millions of colors.\r\rColorForms have several uses:\r  1) Precise colors. You can have up to 256 true colors, instead being limited to the 8-bit color palette.\r  2) Easy transparency. Just store (Color transparent) at the desired position in the color map.\r  3) Cheap color remapping by changing the color map.\r\rA color map is an Array of up to 2^depth Color objects. A Bitmap colorMap is automatically computed and cached for rapid display. Note that if you change the color map, you must resubmit it via the colors: method to flush this cache.\r\rColorForms can be a bit tricky. Note that:\r  a) When you BitBlt from one ColorForm to another, you must remember to copy the color map of the source ColorForm to the destination ColorForm.\r  b) A ColorForm's color map is an array of depth-independent Color objects. BitBlt requires a BitMap of actual pixel values, adjusted to the destination depth. These are different things! ColorForms automatically maintain a cache of the BitBlt-style color map corresponding to the colors array for the last depth on which the ColorForm was displayed, so there should be little need for clients to work with BitBlt-style color maps.\r  c) The default map for 8 bit depth has black in the first entry, not transparent.

The DSA algorithm was proposed in 1991 and became a standard in May 1994. The official description is available as a Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB 186, May 19, 1994). A companion standard, the Secure Hash Standard, or SHS (FIPS PUB 180-1, April 17, 1995), describes a 160-bit message digest algorithm known as the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA). This message digest is used to compute the document signature.\r\rHere's how to use it:\r\r  1. The \"signer\" creates a pair of keys. One of these must be kept private. The other may be freely distributed. For example, it could be built into the signature checking code of an application.\r\r  2. When the signer wishes to sign a packet of data (a \"message\") , he uses the secure hash algorithm to create a 160-bit message digest (hash) which is used as the input to DSA. The result of this is a pair of large numbers called a \"signature\" that is attached to the original message.\r\r  3. When someone receives a signed message purported to have come from the signer, they compute the 160-bit hash of the message and pass that, along with the message signature and the signer's public key, to the signature verification algorithm. If the signature checks, then it is virtually guaranteed that the message originated from someone who had the signer's private key. That is, the message is not a forgery and has not been modified since it was signed. For example, if the message contains a program, and the recipient trusts the signer, then the recipient can run the program with the assurance that it won't do anything harmful. (At least, not intentionally. A digital signature is no guarantee against bugs! :->)\r\rThe signer must keep the private key secure, since anyone who has the private key can forge the signer's signature on any message they like. As long as the secret key is not stolen, cryptographers believe it to be virtually impossible either to forge a signature, to find a message that matches an existing sigature, or to discover the signer's private key by analyzing message signatures. Knowing the public key (which, for example, could be recovered from an application that had it built in), does not weaken the security at all.\r\rAn excellent reference work on digital signatures and cryptography in general is:\r\r  Schneier, Bruce\r  \"Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C\"\r  John Wiley and Sons, 1996.\r\rI used this book as a guide to implementing many of the numerical algorithms required by DSA.\r\rPatents and Export Restrictions:\r\rMany digital signature technologies are patented. DSA is also patented, but the patent is owned by the U.S. government which has made DSA available royalty-free. There is a claim that the government patent infringes on an earlier patent by Schnorr, but the government is requiring the use of DSA, so they apparently believe this claim is not strong enough to be a serious threat to their own patent.\r\rMost cryptography technology, including digital signature technology, requires an export license for it to be distributed outside the U.S. Recent legislation may have relaxed the export license requirements, but it would be prudent to check the current regulations before exporting this code.","superclass":"Object","subclasses":[],"name":"DigitalSignatureAlgorithm"},{"package":"FileSystem-Core","depth":6,"comment":"I am raised when I an operation is attempted inside a directory that does not exist.

Sista is an optimizer that exists in the Smalltalk image, /not/ in the VM,  and optimizes by substituting normal bytecoded methods by optimized bytecoded methods that may use special bytecodes for which the Cogit can generate faster code.  These bytecodes eliminate overheads such as bounds checks or polymorphic code (indexing Array, ByteArray, String etc).  But the bulk of the optimization performed is in inlining blocks and sends for the common path.  This bytecode set therefore differs from a normal Smalltalk set in providing a set of inlined primitives that do not validate their arguments that the compiler generates only when it can prove that the primitives' arguments are valid.\r\rThe basic scheme is that the Cogit generates code containing performance counters.  When these counters trip, a callback into the image is performed, at which point Sista analyses some portion of the stack, looking at performance data for the methods on the stack, and optimises based on the stack and performance data.  Execution then resumes in the optimized code.\r\rThe Sista Cogit (e.g. SistaStackToRegisterMappingCogit) adds counters to conditional branches.  Each branch has an executed and a taken count.  On execution the executed count is decremented and if the count goes below zero the VM sends a message at a special index in the specialObjectsArray (as of writing, conditionalCounterTrippedOn:).  Then if the branch is taken the taken count is decremented.  The two counter values allow the Sista optimizer to collect basic block execution paths and to know what are the \"hot\" paths through execution that are worth agressively optimizing.  Since conditional branches are about 1/6 as frequent as sends, and since they can be used to determine the hot path through code, they are a better choice to count than, for example, method or block entry.\r\rThe VM provides a primitive that fills an Array with the state of the counters, and the state of each linked send in a method.  Tthe optimizer obtains the branch and send data for a method via this primitive.\r\rThis bytecde set encodes a bytecode set for Smalltalk that lifts limits on the number of literals and branch distances, and extended push integer and push character bytecodes.  Bytecodes are ordered by length to make decoding easier.  Bytecodes marked with an * are extensible via a prefix bytecode.\r\rN.B.  Extension bytecodes can only come before extensible bytecodes, and only if valid (one cannot extend a bytecode extensible by Ext A with an Ext B).  An extensible bytecode consumes (and zeros) its extension(s).  Hence the hidden implicit variables holding extensions are always zero except after a valid sequence of extension bytecodes.\r\rInstance Variables (inherited)\r\r1 Byte

superclass of some class.  It has two forms, \"normal\" and \"directed\". In the normal form, the class is the value of the method's methodClassAssociation which must be the last literal.  In the directed form the class is the class on top of stack.\r\r(2) The Call Primitive Bytecode specifies either a primitive in the primitive table (m=0) or an inlined primitive (m=1). Non-inlined primtiives from the primitive table have index (jjjjjjj * 256) + iiiiiiii and return from the method if they succeed.  This bytecode is only valid as the first bytecode of a method.  Inline primitives have index (jjjjjjj * 256) + iiiiiiii, cannot fail, and do not return when they succeed, yielding a result (typically on top of stack after popping their arguments, but possibly in a byte data stack, for example for unboxed floating-point primitives).\r\r[Sista specific] The 3 bytecodes with this annotations are not used in the default Pharo runtime but only in specific circumstances (Sista runtime, etc.)\r\rHere is the specification of the sista unsafe instructions (unsafe operations, set 00). The lowcode set uses external specifications.\r\rWe sort the inline primitive operations by arity.  Nullary primitives occupy the 0-999 range. Unary primitives occupy the 1-1999 range, up until 5 args. Primitives starting at 6000 are jumps. 6000-6999 are 1 parameter jump (the distance), 7000-7999 are 2 parameters jump and jumps over 8000 have 3 parameters.\r\rAll jumps encoded as inlined primitives (mapped or not) use the pushIntegerLong: scheme to push their jump size on stack.\r\rWe define the following *non-mapped* inlined primitives:\r1000\trawClass\rnot a forwarder => Behavior (Same as

Ephemerons are key-value objects (subclasses of Association) with special semantics during garbage collection.  My special behavior can resumed as follows:\r\r- The garbage collection will iterate my instances only if the key is not referenced strongly by another object.\r- Then, if no strong references to the key are found, then the values of this ephemeron are hold weakly.\r- Otherwise, the values are hold strongly.\r\rIn this implementation, an Ephemeron can hold more than one value, which are all treated in the same manner. This ephemeron instance knows its container, which allows the ephemeron to remove itself from a container (such as a Dictionary) upon finalization.\r\r!! Example usages\r\rIn general terms, do not use myself directly. Use instead an Ephemeric container like EphemeronRegistry. An Ephemeron registry will guarantee the collection of keys and values of the object inside the Ephemeron.\r\rOtherwise, if you want to use it, you can create an Ephemeron as any association:\r\rephemeron := Ephemeron key: aKey value: aValue.\rephemeron container: aContainer.\r\r!!

That is, the ephemeron instance cannot be reused.\r\rOn the image side, the finalization process will send the message #mourn to an Ephemeron.  #mourn will #finalize the Ephemeron's key, and remove the Ephemeron from it's container to allow its collection during a subsequent garbage collection.\r\r!!

Most word-like objects are subclasses from ArrayedCollection. Hence, we may have used the method #writeOn: to serialize, and #newFromStream: to materialize. \r\r#writeOn: is slow because it ALWAYS encode wors in a big endian format. Most machines today are even little endian. Even worst, #newFromStream: has to always do a #restoreEndianness. \r\r#newFromStream: is fast because it uses the method #nextWordsInto: which is a hack but that is really fast.

But since the huffman tree lookup determines the efficiency of the decompression, reversing the bits before traversal is expensive. Therefore the entries in each table are stored in REVERSE BIT ORDER. This is achieved by a reverse increment of the current table index in the huffman table construction phase (see method increment:bits:). According to my measures this speeds up the implementation by about 30-40%.\r\rb) Inplace storage of code meanings and extra bits\rRather than looking up the meaning for each code during decompression of blocks we store the appropriate values directly in the huffman tables, using a pre-defined mapping.

In addition you cannot perform a lazzy computation on potentially infinite stream of objects. \r\rGenerators offer a nice solution to such problem. Generators provide a way to use blocks to define a stream of values. The return values are computed one at a time, as needed, and hence need not even be finite. \r\rA generator needs a block and will make sure that the block is executed once at a time and that the block has the control to decide when to yield computation. A generator offers an API that is compatible with the one of stream since it act as a stream of objects. \r\rA generator should be instantiated using the expression ==Generator on: [...]==. \rThe following code creates an infinite streams of 1. \r\r[[[\r| g | \rg := Generator on: [ :gen | [ gen yield: 1 ] repeat ].\rg next\r> 1\rg next \r> 1\r]]]\r\r!! Behavior \r\rThe generator itself is passed to the block, and as soon as a message like ==next==, ==peek==, ==atEnd== or ==peekFor:== is sent to the generator, execution of the block starts/resumes and goes on until the generator's ==yield:== method is called: then the argument of ==yield:== will be the generator's next element. \r\rIf the block goes on to the end without calling ==yield:==, the generator will produce no more elements and ==atEnd== will return true.\r\r\rA generator is a quick way to create a stream of objects. A generator is a kind of pluggable stream, in that a user-supplied blocks defines which values are in a stream.\r\rFor example, here is an empty generator and two infinite generators:\r\r[[[\rGenerator on: [ :gen | ]\rGenerator on: [ :gen | [ gen yield: 1 ] repeat ]\r]]]\r\rAs a more concrete example taken from GNU Smalltalk implementation, these lines process a file and create Person objects out of the file:\r\r[[[\rlines := file lines.\rlines := lines select: [ :line | line ~ '^[A-Za-z]+ [0-9]+$' ].\rfields := lines collect: [ :line | line subStrings ].\rpeople := fields collect: [ :data |\r            Person name: data first age: data second asInteger ].\r]]]\rLet's see how to rewrite them to use a single Generator instead:\r\r[[[\rGenerator on: [ :gen |\r    file linesDo: [ :line || data |\r        line ~ '^[A-Za-z]+ [0-9]+$' ifTrue: [\r            data := line subStrings.\r            gen yield: (Person name: data first age: data second asInteger) ] ] ].\r]]]\rAs you can see, ==select:== becomes an if-statement, and the value from the final stream is yielded to the user of the generator.\rGenerators use continuations, but they shield the users from their complexity by presenting the \rsame simple interface as streams.\r\r\rInstance Variables\r\tblock:\t\t<BlockClosure> The block associated with the generator.\r\tcontinue:\t<MethodContext>\tThe continuation to return to.\r\thome:\t\t<MethodContext>\tThe home (root) context of the activated block\r\tnext:\t\t<Object>\t\tThe next object to return from the Generator.\r","superclass":"Stream","subclasses":[],"name":"Generator"},{"package":"Collections-Tests","depth":5,"comment":"SUnit tests for class Generator","superclass":"TestCase","subclasses":[],"name":"GeneratorTest"},{"package":"Deprecated70","depth":6,"comment":"/!\\ I AM DEPRECATED. \r\rPlease, use my superclass instead.","superclass":"GlamourPresentationPresenter","subclasses":[],"name":"GlamourPresentationModel"},{"package":"Glamour-SpecIntegration","depth":5,"comment":"I am a Spec ComposableModel for all Glamour presentations (GLMPresentation subclasses.)

Origin 1960s: from go for, i.e. go and fetch.\r: ''The New Oxford American Dictionary''\r\r! Synopsis\r\rGofer is a small tool on top of Monticello that loads, updates, merges, diffs, reverts, commits, recompiles and unloads groups of Monticello packages. Contrary to existing tools Gofer makes sure that these operations are performed as clean as possible:\r\r- Gofer treats packages from one or more repository in one operation.\r- Gofer works with fixed versions or tries to find the \"latest\" version using a given package name.\r- Gofer automatically assigns repositories to all packages, so that the other tools are ready to be used on individual packages.\r- Gofer makes sure that there is only one repository instance registered for a single physical location.\r- Gofer works with Monticello dependencies and uniformly treats them like the primary package.\r- Gofer prefers to work with faster repositories if there is a choice.\r- Gofer cleans up after Monticello, no empty class categories and no empty method protocols are to be expected.\r- Gofer supports operations to sync remote and local repositories with each other.\r\r! Installation\r\rGofer is included with the latest Pharo and GemStone distributions. To update to the latest version you can use Gofer itself:\r\r== Gofer upgrade\r\rIn case you are missing Gofer in your image, grab it from *http://source.lukas-renggli.ch/gofer.html*.\r\r! Description\r\rGofer is very simple by design, the basic useage scenario is always the same and consists of three steps:\r\r# You specify one or more Monticello repository URLs. You can do this using the methods ==url:==, ==url:username:password:== (HTTP, FTP), ==directory:==, or ==repository:== if you need full control. You might also use the convenience methods like ==squeaksource:==, ==wiresong:==, or ==gemsource:== for well known repositories. Additionally the following settings are available:\r#- Gofer implicitly declares the local package cache as a repository. To disable the local package cache use the method ==disablePackageCache==, to re-enable use ==enablePackageCache==.\r#- Gofer throws an error if a repository is not reachable. To silently ignore repository erros use the message ==disableRepositoryErrors==, to re-enable use ==enableRepositoryErrors==.\r# You specify one or more Monticello packages you want to work with, by adding them to the Gofer instance.

I am an abstract class, my subclasses will represent concrete repositories such as monticello or git repositories. I define the main API and I have some common methods defined as template methods.\r\r! Instantiation\rCheck my subclasses to know how to instantiate them.\r\r! Basic  repository properties\r\rAll repositories have two main properties: a name and a working copy. \r - name is used to identify a repository\r - the working copy is used to manage the status of all code loaded from the repository. See #IceWorkingCopy\r\r! The repository HEAD\r\rMoreover, every repository has to define a HEAD. The repository HEAD is a reference to our current working commit/branch in the repository.\r\r  repository head.\r\rThe head can be either a branch or a commit. To access the current commit you can ask the head for its commit, or directly the repository for its headCommit (Yes, commits and branches are polymorphic, a commit returns self when asked for its commit).\r\r  repository head commit.\r  repository headCommit.\r\rHEAD is an important concept inside iceberg. It is used to calculate if our code is synchronized, if we have commits to fetch and load, and so on...\r\rMoreover, please notice that HEAD is a repository property, and it is completely separate from the image's state. The image can have code loaded from commits other than HEAD, and vice-versa. More of it is explained in IceWorkingCopy class comment.\r\r! Branches\r\rAn iceberg repository natively  supports branches. To query the branches in the repository you can ask for:\r\r  repository localBranches.\r  repository remoteTrackedBranches.\r  repository allBranches.\r\rOther convenience methods also provide:\r\r  repository localBranchNames.\r  repository remoteBranchNames.\r\rTake into account that such methods will return only already fetched branches. If the branch exists in a remote repository, you should need to do a #fetch before being able to see it.\r\rBranches can also be queried by name, using the utility methods\r\r  repository branchNamed: aName.\r  repository branchNamed: aName ifAbsent: [ ... ].\r  repository branchNamed: aName ifPresent: [ ... ].\r  repository branchNamed: aName ifAbsent: [ ... ] ifPresent: [ ... ].\r\rand the variant for remote branches.\r\r  repository remoteBranchNamed: aName.\r  repository remoteBranchNamed: aName ifAbsent: [ ... ].\r  repository remoteBranchNamed: aName ifPresent: [ ... ].\r  repository remoteBranchNamed: aName ifAbsent: [ ... ] ifPresent: [ ... ].\r\rBranches can be created from a specific commit or, by default, from #headCommit.\r\r  repository createBranch: aBranchName.\r  repository createBranch: aBranchName inCommit: aCommit.\r\rNotice that creating a branch will switch to it automatically.\r\rThe variant #ensureBranch: will create a branch only if a branch with the same name does not exist.\r\r  repository ensureBranch: aBranchName.\r\rAlso, to create a branch tracking a remote branch (that is, that will start from the same commit and follow the evolution of a remote branch), you can use #createBranchTracking: aBranchName.\r\rFinally, to switch to an existing branch:\r\r  repository switchToBranchNamed: aBranchName.\r\r! Remotes\r\rRemotes are references to remote repositories. Remotes are used for pulling and pushing commits and branches.\rRemotes can be added using the #addRemote: message and removed using the remoteRemote: message . However, thou shall be careful, remotes should be created from the class corresponding to the repository. For example, git repositories should use git remotes, and so on. Check IceRemote and its concrete subclasses.\r\r  repository addRemote: aRemote.\r\rOnce remotes are configured, we can configure them as pull remote and push remote. A pull remote is a remote used for pulling commits by default, while a push remote is a remote used for pushing new commits by default.\r\r  repository pullRemote: aRemote.\r  repository pushRemote: aRemote.\r\r  repository isPullRemote: aRemote.\r  repository isPushRemote: aRemote.\r\rIf pull or push remotes are not configured, they will default to 'origin'. Origin is a well known remote, for which an accessor to the 'origin' remote  is provided through the #origin message.\r\r  repository origin.\r\rRemotes can be queried with:\r\r  repository remotes.\r  repository remoteNamed: aName.\r  repository remoteNamed: aName ifAbsent: [ ... ].\r\rMoreover, we can query if the current branch has commits to be uploaded using the #outgoingCommits and friends, or if the current branch has commits to be downloaded using the #ingoingCommits and friends.\r\r  repository hasIncomingCommits.\r  repository incomingCommits.\r  repository hasIncomingCommitsFrom: aRemote.\r  repository incomingCommitsFrom: aRemote.\r\r  repository hasOutgoingCommits.\r  repository outgoingCommits.\r  repository hasOutgoingCommitsTo: aRemote.\r  repository outgoingCommitsTo: aRemote.\r\rFinally, we can interact with remotes via the fetch, pull and push operations.\rFetch downloads new commits and branches from the specified remote.\rPull and push operations delegate to pull and push of the current branch. Check IceLocalBranch.\r\r  repository fetch.\r  repository pull.\r  repository push.\r\r! Committing code\r\rOnce modifications are done, we can commit them to the repository using the commit* messages. The main API for it is #commitWithMessage: that will commit all changes with the given commit.\r\r  repository commitWithMessage: 'aMessage in a string'.\r\rA second commit message is also available to commit cherry picks:\r\r  repository commitCherryPick: aChangesList withMessage: ' a message in a string'.\r\rNOTICE that commits can only be done if the following is true:\r\r - HEAD is a branch\r - the working copy reference commit is the same commit as #headCommit\r\rIn any other case, commits are forbidden as they may break the repository consistency.\r\r! Loading code & Package querying\r\rFrom the repository point of view, only some convenience methods are provided to checkout all code from the current branch, unload all loaded code, know what packages are loaded or modified.

My main responsibilities are the bookeeping of loaded packages, the loaded commits, the modification and diffs, and the main entry point for committing code.\r\r! Adding and Loading Packages\r\rAdding a working copy to a repository is achieved by the message addPackageNamed:\r\r  repository addPackageNamed: aPackageNameString.\r\rI can be later on queried using the following messages\r\r  repository includesPackageNamed: aPackageNameString.\r  repository isLoadedPackageNamed: aPackageNameString.\r\r  repository packageNames.\r\rPackages already in a repository can be loaded and unloaded with:\r\r  repository checkoutPackageNamed: aPackageNameString.\r  repository unloadPackageNamed: aPackageNameString.\r\rAnd queried with:\r\r  repository loadedPackages.\r\r! The Working Copy State\r\rThe working copy can be in different states depending on the repository and the package. It is the working copy state reponsibility to decide wether we can commit, if we are on a merge, and so on... The working copy state can be obtained through the message #workingCopyState.\r\r  workingCopy workingCopyState.\r\rThe working copy state is calculated every time that it is called. This is because the state of the repository can be modified from outside the system (e.g.,  the command line or another tool). In any case, calculating the working copy state is fast enough to be executed on-line even for big repositories such as Pharo's. The working copy state is calculated from the status of each of its packages. It was decided like this because it may happen that somebody downloads a package from different commits. If this situation changes in the future, this is a good point for simplification.\r\rWorking copy states are instances of IceWorkingCopyState. Check it and its subclasses for more information.\r\r! The Current Commit(s)\r\rA crucial information bookeept by the working copy is the current loaded commit(s). Indeed, depending on the state of the packages and the loaded code, there may be a single current commit or several:\r\r - having a single commit means that all loaded packages were loaded from the same commit\r - having multiple commits mean that we are in a merge situation\r - having no commit means that no packages were loaded or that they were loaded from another mechanism such as monticello \r\rIn general terms, the current commit should not be accessed directly.\r\rThe following methods allow for testing and accessing the current commits:\r\r  repository hasSingleCommit.\r  repository hasUnknownCommit.\r  repository isInMerge.\r\r  repository referenceCommit.\r  repository referenceCommits.\r\r!  Changes and Committing\r\rThe working copy bookkeeps the loaded packages and their state and thus it provides methods to query and commit those changes into the repository.\r\r  repository modifiedPackages.\r  repository isModified.\r\r  repository commitWithMessage: aMessageString.\r  repository commitChanges: aListOfChanges withMessage: aMessagString.\r  repository commitPackages: aListOfPackages withMessage: aMessageString.\r\rNOTICE that commits can only be done if the following is true:\r\r - repositroy HEAD is not detached (i.e., it is a branch)\r - I am not detached. I.e., my reference commit (in case of a merge, it should be the first one) is the same commit as #headCommit\r\rSuch validations can be verified with the following messages\r\r  repository validateCanCommit.\r  repository isDetached.\r\r!  Merging\r\rThe main entry point for merging a commit is the working copy, through the method #mergeCommit:. This method will, delegating to the working copy state, verify that the commit needs to be merged, can be merged, and if it has conflicts. In case there are no conflicts an automatic merge will be issued by default.\r\r  workingCopy mergeCommit: aCommit.\r\rIMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION NOTE.

The tree is made up of subsequent tables storing all entries at the current bit depth. Each entry in the table (e.g., a 32bit Integer value) is either a leaf or a non-leaf node. Leaf nodes store the immediate value in its low 16 bits whereas non-leaf nodes store the offset of the subtable in its low 16bits. The high 8 bits of non-leaf nodes contain the number of additional bits needed for the sub table (the high 8 bits of leaf-nodes are always zero). The first entry in each table is always a non-leaf node indicating how many bits we need to fetch initially. We can thus travel down the tree as follows (written in sort-of-pseudocode the actual implementation can be seen in InflateStream>>decodeValueFrom:):\r\r\ttable := initialTable.\r\tbitsNeeded := high 8 bits of (table at: 1).\t\t\"Determine initial bits\"\r\ttable := initialTable + (low 16 bits of (table at: 1)). \"Determine start of first real table\"\r\t[bits := fetch next bitsNeeded bits.\t\t\t\"Grab the bits\"\r\tvalue := table at: bits.\t\t\t\t\t\t\"Lookup the value\"\r\tvalue has high 8 bit set] whileTrue:[\t\t\"Check if it's leaf\"\r\t\ttable := initialTable + (low 16 bits of value).\t\"No - compute new sub table start\"\r\t\tbitsNeeded := high 8 bit of value].\t\t\"Compute additional number of bits needed\"\r\t^value\r","superclass":"ReadStream","subclasses":["FastInflateStream"],"name":"InflateStream"},{"package":"InitializePackagesCommandLineHandler","depth":4,"comment":"Usage: initializePackages [ --protocols=<protocols> ] [ --packages=<packages> ]  [ --save ]\r\tprotocols\tA name of a file with method protocols specification\r\tpackages\ta name of a file with packages list\r\t\rDocumentation:\rInitializes packages structure from information provided in text files.

Unlike git checkout, it does not move the HEAD\r * commit for you - use `git_repository_set_head` or the like to do that.\r *\r * Checkout looks at (up to) four things: the \"target\" tree you want to\r * check out, the \"baseline\" tree of what was checked out previously, the\r * working directory for actual files, and the index for staged changes.\r *\r * You give checkout one of three strategies for update:\r *\r * - `GIT_CHECKOUT_NONE` is a dry-run strategy that checks for conflicts,\r *   etc., but doesn't make any actual changes.\r *\r * - `GIT_CHECKOUT_FORCE` is at the opposite extreme, taking any action to\r *   make the working directory match the target (including potentially\r *   discarding modified files).\r *\r * - `GIT_CHECKOUT_SAFE` is between these two options, it will only make\r *   modifications that will not lose changes.\r *\r *                         |  target == baseline   |  target != baseline  |\r *    ---------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|\r *     workdir == baseline |       no action       |  create, update, or  |\r *                         |                       |     delete file      |\r *    ---------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|\r *     workdir exists and  |       no action       |   conflict (notify   |\r *       is != baseline    | notify dirty MODIFIED | and cancel checkout) |\r *    ---------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|\r *      workdir missing,   | notify dirty DELETED  |     create file      |\r *      baseline present   |                       |                      |\r *    ---------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|\r *\r * To emulate `git checkout`, use `GIT_CHECKOUT_SAFE` with a checkout\r * notification callback (see below) that displays information about dirty\r * files.  The default behavior will cancel checkout on conflicts.\r *\r * To emulate `git checkout-index`, use `GIT_CHECKOUT_SAFE` with a\r * notification callback that cancels the operation if a dirty-but-existing\r * file is found in the working directory.  This core git command isn't\r * quite \"force\" but is sensitive about some types of changes.\r *\r * To emulate `git checkout -f`, use `GIT_CHECKOUT_FORCE`.\r *\r *\r * There are some additional flags to modified the behavior of checkout:\r *\r * - GIT_CHECKOUT_ALLOW_CONFLICTS makes SAFE mode apply safe file updates\r *   even if there are conflicts (instead of cancelling the checkout).\r *\r * - GIT_CHECKOUT_REMOVE_UNTRACKED means remove untracked files (i.e. not\r *   in target, baseline, or index, and not ignored) from the working dir.\r *\r * - GIT_CHECKOUT_REMOVE_IGNORED means remove ignored files (that are also\r *   untracked) from the working directory as well.\r *\r * - GIT_CHECKOUT_UPDATE_ONLY means to only update the content of files that\r *   already exist.  Files will not be created nor deleted.  This just skips\r *   applying adds, deletes, and typechanges.\r *\r * - GIT_CHECKOUT_DONT_UPDATE_INDEX prevents checkout from writing the\r *   updated files' information to the index.\r *\r * - Normally, checkout will reload the index and git attributes from disk\r *   before any operations.  GIT_CHECKOUT_NO_REFRESH prevents this reload.\r *\r * - Unmerged index entries are conflicts.  GIT_CHECKOUT_SKIP_UNMERGED skips\r *   files with unmerged index entries instead.  GIT_CHECKOUT_USE_OURS and\r *   GIT_CHECKOUT_USE_THEIRS to proceed with the checkout using either the\r *   stage 2 (\"ours\") or stage 3 (\"theirs\") version of files in the index.\r *\r * - GIT_CHECKOUT_DONT_OVERWRITE_IGNORED prevents ignored files from being\r *   overwritten.  Normally, files that are ignored in the working directory\r *   are not considered \"precious\" and may be overwritten if the checkout\r *   target contains that file.\r *\r * - GIT_CHECKOUT_DONT_REMOVE_EXISTING prevents checkout from removing\r *   files or folders that fold to the same name on case insensitive\r *   filesystems.  This can cause files to retain their existing names\r *   and write through existing symbolic links.\r */","superclass":"LGitExternalEnumerationUInt32","subclasses":[],"name":"LGitCheckoutStrategyEnum"},{"package":"LibGit-Core","depth":4,"comment":"Please comment me using the following template inspired by Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) design:\r\rFor the Class part:  State a one line summary.

If the optional plus\r           + is used, the local ref is updated even if it does not result in a fast-forward\r           update.\r\r               Note\r               If the remote branch from which you want to pull is modified in non-linear\r               ways such as being rewound and rebased frequently, then a pull will attempt a\r               merge with an older version of itself, likely conflict, and fail. It is under\r               these conditions that you would want to use the + sign to indicate\r               non-fast-forward updates will be needed. There is currently no easy way to\r               determine or declare that a branch will be made available in a repository\r               with this behavior; the pulling user simply must know this is the expected\r               usage pattern for a branch.\r\r               Note\r               You never do your own development on branches that appear on the right hand\r               side of a <refspec> colon on Pull: lines; they are to be updated by git\r               fetch. If you intend to do development derived from a remote branch B, have a\r               Pull: line to track it (i.e.  Pull: B:remote-B), and have a separate branch\r               my-B to do your development on top of it. The latter is created by git branch\r               my-B remote-B (or its equivalent git checkout -b my-B remote-B). Run git\r               fetch to keep track of the progress of the remote side, and when you see\r               something new on the remote branch, merge it into your development branch\r               with git pull . remote-B, while you are on my-B branch.\r\r               Note\r               There is a difference between listing multiple <refspec> directly on git pull\r               command line and having multiple Pull: <refspec> lines for a <repository> and\r               running git pull command without any explicit <refspec> parameters. <refspec>\r               listed explicitly on the command line are always merged into the current\r               branch after fetching. In other words, if you list more than one remote refs,\r               you would be making an Octopus. While git pull run without any explicit\r               <refspec> parameter takes default <refspec>s from Pull: lines, it merges only\r               the first <refspec> found into the current branch, after fetching all the\r               remote refs. This is because making an Octopus from remote refs is rarely\r               done, while keeping track of multiple remote heads in one-go by fetching more\r               than one is often useful.\rSome short-cut notations are also supported.\r\r           o    tag <tag> means the same as refs/tags/<tag>:refs/tags/<tag>; it requests\r               fetching everything up to the given tag.\r\r           o   A parameter <ref> without a colon fetches that ref into FETCH_HEAD, and\r               updates the remote-tracking branches (if any).","superclass":"Object","subclasses":[],"name":"LGitRefSpec"},{"package":"LibGit-Core","depth":8,"comment":"A LGitReference represents the reference to a git object.

For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. A topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

It is mainly an handler for a PluggableMenuItemSpec. \r\rA menu item is declared withing a particular method tagged with a pragma. This kind-of method takes a builder as argument and its evaluation results in the building of a MenuRegistration sub-tree which is stored in the builder.   As an example:\rMenuRegistrationExample class>>myOwnCoolToolRegistrationOn: aBuilder \r\t<worldMenuExample> \r\t(aBuilder item: #MyOwnCoolTool)\r\t\tlabel: 'My own cool tool';\r\t\ttarget: Workspace; \r\t\tselector: #openContents: ;\r\t\targuments: #('yep, my own cool tool can be opened from the world menu ! :)')\r\t\rEvaluating this method results in the creation of a MenuRegistration which name is #MyOwnCoolTool. Thus, the resulting sub-tree is only made of a root node. After it has be built, this root node is recorded in the builder. To experiment this, just evaluate the following code:\r-------------\r| builder |\rbuilder := PragmaMenuBuilder new.\rMenuRegistrationExample myOwnCoolToolRegistrationOn: builder.\rbuilder explore\r-------------\r\rUsing pragma allows the menu builder to dynamically discover which are the methods to evaluate in order to build a menu. Thus, a resulting menu is built by evaluating a set of methods which share the same pragma keyword.\rIn the following example, all method having <worldMenuExample> are evaluated for the building of the resulting menu:\r---------------\r(PragmaMenuBuilder pragmaKeyword: 'worldMenuExample' model: nil) menu popUpInWorld\r---------------\r\rWithin a method, three kind of declarations can be used: (1) item by item (2) an item with a sub-menu and (3) a group.\r\r1 -  item by item menu registration declaration:\rThis kind of declaring is for the setting of one menu item and only one within a method.\r\r1.1 -  A simple menu item with an action\rIn the following example, a menu item with the name #'Browser' and a action which \rconsists in sending #openClassBrowser to StandardToolSet is declared:\r\rAClassSomewhere class>>openBrowserOn: aBuilder\r\t<myMenuTest>\r\t(aBuilder item: #'Browser') \r\t\ttarget: StandardToolSet; \r\t\tselector: #openClassBrowser.\r\rA simple action without any argument can also be set with a block:\r\t(aBuilder item: #'Browser') action: [StandardToolSet openClassBrowser]\r\rYou can also indicate a balloon help string and a particular icon:\r\t(aBuilder item: #'Browser') \r\t\taction: [StandardToolSet openClassBrowser];\r\t\thelp: 'Open a system browser';\r\t\ticon: MenuIcons smallSystemBrowserIcon\r\rIf the action needs one or several arguments, you can also give it/them as follow:\r\t(aBuilder item: #'Save and quit') \r\t\ttarget: SmalltalkImage current; \r\t\tselector: #snapshot:andQuit:.\r\t\targuments: #(true true)\r\t\t\rBy default, the item label is set with the item name but it can be explicitly given as follow:\r\t(aBuilder item: #'Browser')\r\t\tlabel: 'System browser'; \r\t\ttarget: StandardToolSet; \r\t\tselector: #openClassBrowser.\r\r1.2  -  Placing the menu item in a  menu\rThe resulting menu item of previous example will be placed at the root of the menu.\rIn order to declare another place for it, you have to explicitly set its parent name.\rAs an example, consider the following item which declares a simple entry with no action.\rSuch item is typically used as a root for a sub-menu tree:\r\rAClassSomewhere class>>openToolsOn: aBuilder\r\t<myMenuTest>\r\t(aBuilder item: #'Tools')\r\rNow, a sub-menu item for #Tools can be declared separately, within another method\rby using the #parent: message:\r\rAnotherClassSomewhere class>>myToolsOn: aBuilder\r\t<myMenuTest>\r\t(aBuilder item: #'CoolTool')\r\t\tlabel: 'Cool tool';\r\t\tparent: #Tools;\r\rNote that the argument of #parent: must be the name of another item. \rIf it is not the case, then the parent name indication is simply ignored.\r\r1.3  -  Item ordering\r\rIf no ordering setting is indicated, items ordering is unpredicable (it depends on method retrieving order). If one want an item to appear at a certain position, it is possible to set it by sending #order: to a MenuRegistration. The #order: message takes a float as argument. \rAs an example, see  the two following declarations, in the resulting menu, Wozy is placed before 'Wozy configuration'\r\rAnotherClassSomewhere class>>myWozySystemOpenOn: aBuilder\r\t<myMenuTest>\r\t(aBuilder item: #'Wozy')\r\t\tparent: #CoolTool;\r\t\torder: 1.0\r\t\t\rAnotherClassSomewhere class>>myWozySystemConfigOn: aBuilder\r\t<myMenuTest>\r\t(aBuilder item: #'Wozy configuration')\r\t\tparent: #CoolTool;\r\t\torder: 2.0\r\r2) Item with a submenu\rThe one menu item - one declaring method way can be ugly. When a set a menu items are known to be put all-together, it is possible to declare the sub-tree in one method. The following example show such a sub-tree with the #Tools item at root and four sub-items declared in a single method. Note a menu target declared for the root is shared by all sub-items. In that case, it also remains possible for a sub-item to declare its own target.\r\rAClassSomewhere class>>openToolsOn: aBuilder\r\t<myMenuTest>\r\t(aBuilder item: #'Tools')\r\t\ttarget:  StandardToolSet; \"The target is shared by all children\"\r\t\twith: [ \"My sub-menu are given here\"\r\t\t\t(aBuilder item: #'System browser') selector: #openClassBrowser.\r\t\t\t(aBuilder item: #Workspace) selector: #openWorkspace.\r\t\t\t(aBuilder item: #'Test Runner') selector: #openTestRunner.\r\t\t\t(aBuilder item: #'Monticello Browser') selector: #openMonticelloBrowser]\r\t\t\r3) group of menu items\rWhen you want some items to be shown always grouped together, you can use a group. Its declaring is like an item with a submenu except that you are using the message #group: instead of #item:. The consequence is that only the children are shown in the menu. Of course, #label and #icon: are ignored for a group. Here is an example:\r\rAClassSomewhere class>>mostUsedToolsOn: aBuilder\r\t<myMenuTest>\r\t(aBuilder group: #MostUsedTools) \"My name can be also used as parent name\"\r\t\twithSeparatorAfter; \"A separator will be added after my last child\"\r\t\torder: 0; \"the entire group will be placed at the top\"\r\t\ttarget:  StandardToolSet; \"The target is shared by all children\"\r\t\twith: [\r\t\t\t(aBuilder item: #'System browser') selector: #openClassBrowser.\r\t\t\t(aBuilder item: #Workspace) selector: #openWorkspace.\r\t\t\t(aBuilder item: #'Test Runner') selector: #openTestRunner.\r\t\t\t(aBuilder item: #'Monticello Browser') selector: #openMonticelloBrowser]\r\r---------------------------\r\t\t\rInstance Variables\r\tisGroup:\t\t<Boolean>\r\titemList:\t\t<SortedCollection>\r\torder:\t\t<Number>\r\towner:\t\t<MenuRegistration>\r\tparentName:\t\t<Symbol>\r\tspec:\t\t<PluggableMenuItemSpec>\r\risGroup\r\t- if true, then this item is ignored and flatten\r\ritemList\r\t- all my MenuRegistration (my sub-menus or my elements if i'm a group)\r\rorder\r\t- my order in the owner list\r\rowner\r\t- my owner\r\rparentName\r\t- the declared parent name which serve as basis for PragmaBenuBuilder>>#arrangeRegistrations\r\rspec\r\t- my PluggableMenuItemSpec\r","superclass":"Object","subclasses":["PragmaMenuBuilder"],"name":"MenuRegistration"},{"package":"MenuRegistration","depth":3,"comment":"I'm here to show you how to use the menu registration.

There is a 1-1 mapping between objects an their anonymous class.

As you are probably all\rtoo aware, today it's a two step process where you first load the\rconfiguration into your image using [Gofer][2] and then load your\rproject using Metacello:\r\r```Smalltalk\rGofer new\r  package: 'ConfigurationOfSeaside30';\r  squeaksource: 'MetacelloRepository';\r  load.\r((Smalltalk at: #ConfigurationOfSeaside30) version: #stable) load.\r```\r\rIn the early days of Metacello (and Gofer) this was a great improvement\rover the alternatives, but today, 3 years after the introduction of\rMetacello, there should be a better way...and there is.\rUsing the *Metacello Scripting API* the above expression reduces to the\rfollowing:\r\r```Smalltalk\rMetacello new\r  configuration: 'Seaside30';\r  load.\r```\r\r## Loading\r\rIn this example of the [`load` command][5] we are leveraging a couple of\rdefault values, namely the `version` of the project and the `repository` where the\r**ConfigurationOfSeaside** package can be found:\r\r```Smalltalk\rMetacello new\r  configuration: 'Seaside30';\r  load.\r```\r\rHere is a variant\rof the same expression with the (current) default values explicitly specified:\r\r```Smalltalk\rMetacello new\r  configuration: 'Seaside30';\r  version: #stable;\r  squeaksource: 'MetacelloRepository';\r  load.\r```\r\rThe `version` attribute can be any legal [version number][10].\r`squeaksource` is a [repository shortcut][4]. You can also specify the\rfull [repository description][3] as follows:\r\r```Smalltalk\rMetacello new\r  configuration: 'Seaside30';\r  version: #stable;\r  repository: 'http://www.squeaksource.com/MetacelloRepository';\r  load.\r```\r\r##Listing\r\rOnce you've loaded one or more projects into your image, you may want to\rlist them. The following is an example of the [`list` command][6]:\r\r```Smalltalk\rMetacello image\r  configuration: [:spec | true ];\r  list.\r```\r\rThe `image` message tells Metacello that you'd like to look\rat only loaded configurations. \r\rThe *block* argument to the\r`configuration:` message is used to *select* against the list of loaded\r[MetacelloProjectSpec][7] instances in the [registry][8].\r\rThe `list` command itself returns a list of [MetacelloProjectSpec][7] instances that can be printed, inspected or otherwise manipulated.\r\rIn addition to a *select block*, you can specify a *select collection*\rspecifying the names of the projects you'd like to select:\r\r```Smalltalk\rMetacello registry\r  configuration: #('Seaside30' 'MetacelloPreview');\r  list.\r```\r\rThe `registry` message tells Metacello that you'd like to\rlook at all projects in the [registry][8] whether or not they are loaded.\r\rThe *collection* argument to the `configuration:` message is used to\r*select* against the list of project names in the [registry][8].\r\rThe `list` command can also be used to look at configurations in\rMonticello repositories. For example:\r\r```Smalltalk\rMetacello new\r  configuration: [:spec | spec name beginsWith: 'Seaside'];\r  squeaksource: 'MetacelloRepository';\r  list.\r```\r\rlists the configurations whose names (sans the `ConfigurationOf`) begin\rwith `Seaside` in the `MetacelloRepositry` in the\r[Squeaksource](http://www.squeaksource.com) repostory.\r\r## Getting\r\rOnce you've loaded a project into your image the next logical step is\rupgrading your project to a new version. \r\rLet's say that a new `#stable` version of Seaside30 has been released\rand that you want to upgrade. This is a two step process: \r\r* [get a new version of the configuration][11]\r* [load the new version][12]\r\r### Get a new version of the configuration\r\rThe following expression gets the latest version of the\rconfiguration:\r\r```Smalltalk\rMetacello image\r  configuration: 'Seaside30';\r  get.\r```\r\rBy using the `image` message, you can leverage the fact that the [registry][8] remembers\rfrom which repository you loaded the original version of the configuration.\r\rThe `get` command simply downloads the latest version of the\rconfiguration package from the repository.\r\rYou may download the configuration from a different repository:\r\r```Smalltalk\rMetacello image\r  configuration: 'Seaside30';\r  squeaksource: 'Seaside30;\r  get.\r```\r\rThe `get` command will update the [registry][8] with the new\rrepository location information.\r\rYou may also use the `get` command to load a configuration for a project\rinto your image without actually loading the project itself:\r\r```Smalltalk\rMetacello image\r  configuration: 'SeasideRest';\r  squeaksource: 'Seaside30';\r  get.\r```\r\rThe 'SeasideRest' project information will be registered in the [registry][8] and marked\ras *unloaded*.\r\r### Load the new version\r\rOnce you've got a new copy of the Seaside30 configuration loaded into your image, you may\rupgrade your image with the following expression:\r\r```Smalltalk\rMetacello image\r  configuration: 'Seaside30';\r  version: #stable;\r  load.\r```\r\rBy using the `image` message, you are asking Metacello to look the\rproject up in the [registry][8] before performing the\roperation, so it isn't necessary to supply all of the project details for every\rcommand operation.\r\rOf course, the `load` command updates the [registry][8].\r\rIf you want to load a project for which you've already done a `get`\r(like the SeasideRest project earlier), you can do the following:\r\r```Smalltalk\rMetacello registry\r  configuration: 'SeasideRest';\r  version: #stable;\r  load.\r```\r\rIn this case you use the `registry` message to indicate that you are\rinterested in both *loaded* and *unloaded* projects.\r\r##Locking\r\rLet's say that you are using an older version of Seaside30 (say 3.0.5)\rinstead of the #stable version (3.0.7) and that your application doesn't\rwork with newer versions of Seaside30 (you've tried and it's more work\rto get you application to work with the newer version of Seaside30 than\rit's worth).\r\rLet's also say that you want to try out something in the\rSeasideRest project, but when you try loading SeasideRest, you end up\rhaving Seaside 3.0.7 loaded as well. \r\rThis is an unfortunate side effect of Metacello trying to *do the right\rthing*, only in your case it is the wrong thing.\r\rFortunately, the [`lock` command][9] can give you control. First you\rneed to `lock` the Seaside30 project:\r\r```Smalltalk\rMetacello image\r  configuration: 'Seaside30';\r  lock.\r```\r\rThe `image` message tells Metacello to do a lookup in the list of loaded\rprojects and then to put a lock on the loaded version of the project.\r\rIf you want you can specify which version of the project you want\rlocked:\r\r```Smalltalk\rMetacello image\r  configuration: 'Seaside30';\r  version: '3.0.5';\r  lock.\r```\r\rAfter a project is locked an error (**MetacelloLockedProjectError**) is \rthrown when you attempt to load a project that has a dependency upon a \rdifferent version of Seaside30. The error is thrown before any packages \rare actually loaded.\r\r### Bypassing locks\r\rLet's say that you want to load the SeasideRest project even though it may\rrequire a version of Seaside30 that is later than the version that you have\rlocked. To do that you need to suppress the upgrade of the Seaside30\rproject during the load of the SeasideRest project and you can do that\rwith the use of the `onUpgrade:` message:\r\r```Smalltalk\rMetacello new\r  configuration: 'SeasideRest';\r  version: #stable;\r  onUpgrade: [:ex :existing :new | \r    existing baseName = 'Seaside30'\r      ifTrue: [ ex disallow ].\r    ex pass ];\r  load.\r```\r\rThe `onUpgrade:` block tells Metacello to disallow the upgrade of any\rproject whose `baseName` is `Seaside30` and to continue with the load.\rOf course if there are any explicit dependencies between SeasideRest and\rthe later version of Seaside30 (missing classes, etc.) then you may very\rwell get load errors or errors while using the SeasideRest, but that's\rthe price you pay for not upgrading.\r\r### Upgrading a locked project\r\rIf you want to explicitly upgrade a locked project, you can use the\r`load` command. The following command will upgrade Seaside30 to version\r3.0.6 even if it is locked:\r\r ```Smalltalk\rMetacello image\r  configuration: 'Seaside30';\r  version: '3.0.6';\r  lock.\r```\r\rThe newly loaded of the project will continue to be locked.\r\r[1]: https://github.com/dalehenrich/metacello-work/blob/master/docs/MetacelloScriptingAPI.md\r[2]: http://www.lukas-renggli.ch/blog/gofer\r[3]: https://github.com/dalehenrich/metacello-work/blob/master/docs/MetacelloScriptingAPI.md#repository-descriptions\r[4]: https://github.com/dalehenrich/metacello-work/blob/master/docs/MetacelloScriptingAPI.md#repository-shortcuts\r[5]: https://github.com/dalehenrich/metacello-work/blob/master/docs/MetacelloScriptingAPI.md#loading\r[6]: https://github.com/dalehenrich/metacello-work/blob/master/docs/MetacelloScriptingAPI.md#listing\r[7]: https://github.com/dalehenrich/metacello-work/blob/master/docs/MetacelloScriptingAPI.md#metacelloprojectspec\r[8]: https://github.com/dalehenrich/metacello-work/blob/master/docs/MetacelloScriptingAPI.md#metacello-project-registry\r[9]: https://github.com/dalehenrich/metacello-work/blob/master/docs/MetacelloScriptingAPI.md#locking\r[10]: https://github.com/dalehenrich/metacello-work/blob/master/docs/MetacelloScriptingAPI.md#metacello-version-numbers\r[11]: https://github.com/dalehenrich/metacello-work/blob/master/docs/MetacelloUserGuide.md#get-a-new-version-of-the-configuration\r[12]: https://github.com/dalehenrich/metacello-work/blob/master/docs/MetacelloUserGuide.md#load-the-new-version","superclass":"Object","subclasses":[],"name":"Metacello"},{"package":"Metacello-Core","depth":3,"comment":"Please comment me using the following template inspired by Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) design:\r\rFor the Class part:  State a one line summary.

Software using Semantic Versioning MUST declare a public API. This API\rcould be declared in the code itself or exist strictly in documentation.\rHowever it is done, it should be precise and comprehensive.\r\r1. A normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are\rnon-negative integers. X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z\ris the patch version. Each element MUST increase numerically by increments of\rone. For instance: 1.9.0 -> 1.10.0 -> 1.11.0.\r\r1. Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that version\rMUST NOT be modified. Any modifications must be released as a new version.\r\r1. Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change\rat any time. The public API should not be considered stable.\r\r1. Version 1.0.0 defines the public API. The way in which the version number\ris incremented after this release is dependent on this public API and how it\rchanges.\r\r1. Patch version Z (x.y.Z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if only backwards\rcompatible bug fixes are introduced. A bug fix is defined as an internal\rchange that fixes incorrect behavior.\r\r1. Minor version Y (x.Y.z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if new, backwards\rcompatible functionality is introduced to the public API. It MUST be\rincremented if any public API functionality is marked as deprecated. It MAY be\rincremented if substantial new functionality or improvements are introduced\rwithin the private code. It MAY include patch level changes. Patch version\rMUST be reset to 0 when minor version is incremented.\r\r1. Major version X (X.y.z | X > 0) MUST be incremented if any backwards\rincompatible changes are introduced to the public API. It MAY include minor\rand patch level changes. Patch and minor version MUST be reset to 0 when major\rversion is incremented.\r\r1. A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of\rdot separated identifiers immediately following the patch version. Identifiers\rMUST be comprised of only ASCII alphanumerics and dash [0-9A-Za-z-].\rPre-release versions satisfy but have a lower precedence than the associated\rnormal version. Examples: 1.0.0-alpha, 1.0.0-alpha.1, 1.0.0-0.3.7,\r1.0.0-x.7.z.92.\r\r1. A build version MAY be denoted by appending a plus sign and a series of dot\rseparated identifiers immediately following the patch version or pre-release\rversion. Identifiers MUST be comprised of only ASCII alphanumerics and dash\r[0-9A-Za-z-]. Build versions satisfy and have a higher precedence than the\rassociated normal version. Examples: 1.0.0+build.1, 1.3.7+build.11.e0f985a.\r\r1. Precedence MUST be calculated by separating the version into major, minor,\rpatch, pre-release, and build identifiers in that order. Major, minor, and\rpatch versions are always compared numerically. Pre-release and build version\rprecedence MUST be determined by comparing each dot separated identifier as\rfollows: identifiers consisting of only digits are compared numerically and\ridentifiers with letters or dashes are compared lexically in ASCII sort order.\rNumeric identifiers always have lower precedence than non-numeric identifiers.\rExample: 1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0-alpha.1 < 1.0.0-beta.2 < 1.0.0-beta.11 <\r1.0.0-rc.1 < 1.0.0-rc.1+build.1 < 1.0.0 < 1.0.0+0.3.7 < 1.3.7+build <\r1.3.7+build.2.b8f12d7 < 1.3.7+build.11.e0f985a.\r\rAbout\r-----\r\rThe Semantic Versioning specification is authored by [Tom\rPreston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com), inventor of Gravatars and\rcofounder of GitHub.\r\rIf you'd like to leave feedback, please [open an issue on\rGitHub](https://github.com/mojombo/semver/issues).\r\r\rLicense\r-------\r\rCreative Commons - CC BY 3.0\rhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\r","superclass":"Magnitude","subclasses":["MetacelloOldSemanticVersionNumber"],"name":"MetacelloSemanticVersionNumber"},{"package":"Metacello-TestsCore","depth":6,"comment":"Please comment me using the following template inspired by Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) design:\r\rFor the Class part:  State a one line summary.

A version part with a leading dash is string.\r\rThe rationale behind splitting a version part into a sequence of strings and numbers is that when comparing version parts, the numeric parts are compared as numbers, e.g. '1.0-pre.1' < '1.0-pre.10', while the strings are compared bytewise. See the next section for details on how versions are compared.\r\r##Comparing versions\r\rWhen two version strings are compared, their version parts are compared left to right. Empty parts are ignored.\r\rIf at some point a version part of one version string is greater than the corresponding version part of another version string, then the first version string is greater than the other one.\r\rIf a version string has extra parts and the common parts are equal, the shorter version string is less than the longer version string (1.0 is less than 1.0.0).\r\rOtherwise, the version strings are equal. \r\r##Comparing version parts\r\rVersion parts are also compared left to right, A string-part that exists is always less-then a nonexisting string-part (1.6-a is less than 1.6).\r\rExamples\r\r```\r1 == 1. < 1.0 == 1..--0\r< 1.1-a < 1.1-aa < 1.1-ab < 1.1-b < 1.1-c\r< 1.1-pre < 1.1-pre.0 \r< 1.1-pre.1-a < 1.1-pre.1-aa < 1.1-pre.1-b < 1.1-pre.1\r< 1.1-pre.2\r< 1.1-pre.10\r< 1.1 < 1.1.0 < 1.1.00\r< 1.10\r< 2.0\r```","superclass":"Magnitude","subclasses":[],"name":"MetacelloVersionNumber"},{"package":"Metacello-TestsCore","depth":6,"comment":"Please comment me using the following template inspired by Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) design:\r\rFor the Class part:  State a one line summary.

I am just like a normal Dictionary, except that I am implemented differently.  Each Class has an instance of MethodDictionary to hold the correspondence between selectors (names of methods) and methods themselves.\r\rIn a normal Dictionary, the instance variable 'array' holds an array of Associations.  Since there are thousands of methods in the system, these Associations waste space.  \r\rEach MethodDictionary is a variable object, with the list of keys (selector Symbols) in the variable part of the instance.  The variable 'array' holds the values, which are CompiledMethods.\r\rAbout flushCache methods and usage.\r\rThe VM caches method lookups in a lookup cache from class,selector pairs to method,primitive pairs, where primitive may be null.  This is called the first-level method lookup cache.  The JIT VM caches message lookups in machine code, so that a particular piece of machine code exists in a state that invokes a method for a specific class very fast by embedding the class reference in a register load and the target method in a call instruction, and having the target method verify this \"cache probe\" (this is an \"in-line cache).  The JIT also caches the translation of a byte coded method to machine code, by hiding a reference to a machine code method in a byte coded method.\r\rThese caches can be invalidated in several circumstances:\r\r1a. if one adds or removes a method from a class's method dictionary it may change the correct results of a lookup not merely of the class whose dictionary was updated but also subclasses of the class.\r1b. if one replaces a method in a method dictionary this changes the target method for a lookup of the selector for the class and subclasses\r\r2. if one wants to rewrite the byte code or literals of a method, for example because a Slot definition has changed, then if the method has been compiled to machine code, the machine code must be discarded before the new code may be executed\r\r1a & 1b are done via Symbol>>flushCache.  In response the normal VM flushes its first-level method lookup cache, and the JIT also scans all of machine code looking for inline caches with that selector, and voiding them, reverting each send site for that selector to the \"unlinked\" state.\r\rThere used to be confusion in Squeak, which Pharo inherited, that using CompiledMethod>>flushCache was somehow the right way to void caches when updating method dictionaries, flushing the old method in the dictionary, if any, and the new method.  It isn't, precisely because adding or removing methods affects the visibility of inherited methods with the same selector.  So MethodDictionary code should use Symbol>>flushCache, and only once, on each update of a method dictionary.  As a result, the VM will ensure that the necessary send caches are flushed for that selector.\r\r2. is done via CompiledMethod>>flushCache.  In response the VM searches the first-level method lookup cache and removes all entries whose target is the method.  In addition the JIT discards the machine code for the method, and searches for all send sites with that method's machine code as the target and voids them, reverting them to the unlinked state.\r\rThe VM must be told to flush the cached state for a compiled method via CompiledMethod>>flushCache and will /try/ and void the state for that method.  But it can't always deal with existing activations of that method, because if there are activations running the machine code, that machine code can't merely be thrown away, and can't be replaced because its length may change, depending on literals or byte codes.  So this kind of byte coded method manipulation needs to be done with case and some understanding of the total system state.","superclass":"Dictionary","subclasses":[],"name":"MethodDictionary"},{"package":"Collections-Tests","depth":5,"comment":"SUnit tests for MethodDictionary","superclass":"TestCase","subclasses":[],"name":"MethodDictionaryTest"},{"package":"Tool-Finder","depth":3,"comment":"I'm a method finder that will find methods from given examples in an array.\rThe examples array should contain one object for the receiver, one object per expected argument and then a final object with the expected result.\rIn other words \r - a unary method example expects an array of input objects #( receiver ) and an expected result\r - a binary method example expects an array with two input objects #( receiver argument ) and an expected result\r - a keyword method example expects an array with at least two elements  #( receiver argument1 argument2 ... ) and an expected results\r\rThe method finder will take the input objects (receiver and arguments) and perform their permutation to be able to find more results.\rThen, it will lookup in the receiver's hierarchy the approuved and forbidden methods to run on the hierarchy and run them on the permutation of objects.\r\rNewMethodFinder new findMethodsByExampleInput: #( 1 2 ) andExpectedResult: 3","superclass":"Object","subclasses":[],"name":"MethodFinder"},{"package":"Tools-Test","depth":4,"comment":"Test sample for MethodFinderTest","superclass":"MethodFinderTopClass","subclasses":[],"name":"MethodFinderBottomClass"},{"package":"Tool-Finder","depth":3,"comment":"I am a message send that can be tested against an expected result.\rIf the result of the message send does not correpond to the expected result, or the message send provoked an error, or the comparison raised an error I return false.","superclass":"Object","subclasses":[],"name":"MethodFinderSend"},{"package":"Tools-Test","depth":5,"comment":"Unit tests for MethodFinder","superclass":"TestCase","subclasses":[],"name":"MethodFinderTest"},{"package":"Tools-Test","depth":3,"comment":"Test sample for MethodFinderTest","superclass":"Object","subclasses":["MethodFinderBottomClass"],"name":"MethodFinderTopClass"},{"package":"OpalCompiler-Tests","depth":3,"comment":"Please comment me using the following template inspired by Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) design:\r\rFor the Class part:  State a one line summary.

A list or tree is made of nodes. Each node can be made of whatever object . This allows the use of morphs inside the tree. A MorphTreeMorph works with a model which must use the TMorphTreeModel trait. MorphTreeModel uses it and can serves  as the model or as a superclass for a specific tree model.\r\rCustomizable columns:\rSeveral customizable columns can be viewed. Columns are separated by resizers used in order to increase or decrease the columns width with the mouse.\rA MorphTreeMorph can have a top header composed of buttons, one button per column. Such a button can have an icon and/or a title and may run some action when clicked on (a typical action is the ordering of the list). You can also allow column drag-and-drop so that a column  can be dynamically moved with a simple drop.\rSee this in action with following example:\r-----------\rClassListExample new openOn: Collection\r-----------\rBy default, the last column is not bounded, so that no resizer is added for it and threre exists no unused space between the last scroller and the right side of the whole tree. But, in some case one want to have a resizer also for the last column. This is the case for data grid as an example This is possible by sending #makeLastColumnBounded to the MorphTreeMorph.\rTry it with:\r-----------\rSimpleGridExample new open\r-----------\r\rSingle and multi-selection:\rA MorphTreeMorph implements single and multiple selection. Multi-selection is allowed by sending  #multiSelection: with true as argument. Several items can be selected with ctrl-click (or cmd-click on mac) or with shift-click (see MorphTreeMorphModel comments to see how to handle selection from the model).\rTry multi-selection with following example:\r------------\rSimplestClassListExample new openOn: Collection\r------------\r\rDouble-click handling:\rYou can allow double-click just by indicating the message to send to the model with the doubleClickSelector: selector.\rTry this with the package-tree example where double-clicking on a class node or or a method node open a browser on the class or on the method:\r------------\rPackageTreeExample new open\r------------\r\rLong list handling:\rFor very long lists or trees, two kind of pager can be used to limit the number of items visible in the list. The idea  is that when you have very long lists, you most of the time do not  want to see all details but just want some visual support for what is in the list: \r- with a simple pager, you indicate how much items are to be seen in one page, the list items are viewed page by page,\r- with a chunk pager you can expand either incrementally or  all-together the number of items once you get to the bottom of the existing items.\rSee SimplestClassListWithPagerExample and SimplestClassListWithChunkExample examples.\rTry them with:\r------------\rSimplestClassListWithPagerExample new openOn: Object.\rSimplestClassListWithChunkExample new openOn: Object.\r------------\r\rColumns/rows coloring:\rMorphTreeMorph makes it possible the coloring of either the columns or the rows. A MorphTreeMorph understands #rowColorForEven:odd: for rows coloring and columnColorForEven:odd: for columns coloring with two colors passed as argument (nil means no color). \rSee following examples:\r-------------\rPackageTreeExample new open. \"For row coloring\"\rClassListExample new openOn: Collection. \"For column coloring\"\r-------------\r\rColumn drag and drop\rA column can be dragged.

The exceptions are ProtoObject (the superclass of Object) and its subclasses.\r\rClass Object provides default behavior common to all normal objects, such as access, copying, comparison, error handling, message sending, and reflection. Also utility messages that all objects should respond to are defined here.\r\rObject has no instance variables, nor should any be added. This is due to several classes of objects that inherit from Object that have special implementations (SmallInteger and UndefinedObject for example) or the VM knows about and depends on the structure and layout of certain standard classes.\r\rClass Variables:\r\tDependentsFields\t\tan IdentityDictionary\r\t\tProvides a virtual 'dependents' field so that any object may have one\r\t\tor more dependent views, synchronized by the changed:/update: protocol.\r\t\tNote that class Model has a real slot for its dependents, and overrides\r\t\tthe associated protocol with more efficient implementations.\r\rBecause Object is the root of the inheritance tree, methods are often defined in Object to give all objects special behaviors needed by certain subsystems or applications, or to respond to certain general test messages such as isMorph.\r\r\r\r\r\rMiscellanous Discussions.\r\rAbout at: index accepting float and not only integers\r \rThis behavior is also free in the sense that the failure code is only invoked when the\rprimitive fails and so adds nothing to the cost of successful accesses,\rwhich are the high dynamic frequency operation.

Stripping out coercions like this will make the system more brittle.  So \rplease do *not* remove this \"hack\".

It is not a hack but there by intent.  The integers are \rsimply a subset of the reals and forcing the programmer to use them is favouring the machine \rabove the programmer.\r\rBut I think you should justify getting rid of it rather than my having to justify keeping it.

(It doesn't necessarily have to be fixed for 3.0 if it looks messy, but if it's a simple fix, it would be worth it.)\r\rIn Morphic, if you have the following text in a workspace:\r\rThis is line 1\rThis is line 2\r\r**and** you have a return character after line 2, you will normally be able to click the mouse two times below line 2 in order to select all the text.  If you edit line 2 (e.g. so that it reads \"line number 2\"), you can still select all the text by clicking below the second line.  However, if you edit line 1, you will not be able to select all the text from the bottom in the same way.  Things get messed up such that the last return character seems to be gone.  In this state, if you position the cursor immediately after the 2, and press the right arrow, the cursor jumps to the beginning of line 2... oof. (report by Doug Way)\r\rWhile I don't have a very deep understanding of the above mentioned method, I was able to determine that text ending in a CR worked better in the editor when the last entry in <lines> had a start of text size + 1 and a stop of text size. I have accordingly added code near the end to ensure this. It seems to have fixed the problem, but we do need to clean this baby up some day. - Bob\r\r\r","superclass":"Object","subclasses":[],"name":"Paragraph"},{"package":"Morphic-Base","depth":3,"comment":"A selection block in a text paragraph ","superclass":"Object","subclasses":[],"name":"ParagraphSelectionBlock"},{"package":"Polymorph-Widgets","depth":12,"comment":"I'm a Dialog whose TextEditors characters are replaced by *. \r\rExample:\r(UITheme builder openModal: \r        (PasswordDialogWindow new\r                title: 'Authentification';\r                textFont: StandardFonts defaultFont;\r                text: 'Enter your password')) entryText explore","superclass":"TextEntryDialogWindow","subclasses":[],"name":"PasswordDialogWindow"},{"package":"Morphic-Core","depth":5,"comment":"A morph whose submorphs comprise a paste-up of rectangular subparts which \"show through\".

Keyboard Shortcuts\r\rPharo has a variety of useful keyboard shortcuts that help you navigate its environment without always using a mouse.\r\r!! Browser Shortcuts\r\rThere are many keyboard shortcuts available in Pharo:\r\r- A full list is available in the System Browser by clicking the window menu button (the triangle) at the top right of the browser title, and selecting the 'Shortcuts Description' menu item.  Alternatively you can evaluate (cmd-d) the following code now:\r\rKMDescription new categories: #(NautilusGlobalShortcuts); openWithSpec.\r\r- Shortcuts are typically multi-key combinations, where you hold a modifier key and press the listed secondary key. For example if something is listed as CMD-F, CMD-C you would press and hold the CMD key while typing  F and then C\r\r- The modifier key varies between platforms:\r - Windows = CTRL\r - Mac/OSX = CMD\r - Linux = CTRL\r\r!! Spotter/Global search\r\rSimilar to the Spotlight search on OSX, or the Windows Search charm - Pharo has a global code search tool that is activated using:  Shift+Enter\r\rThis search tool shows a popup window on the center of the screen where you can incrementally search for classes, packages, symbols,  pragmas, files, folders and many other types of data.  As you type a search query  all available searches are performed at the same time and results are displayed as they are discovered and grouped based on the type of the search.\r\rYou can cursor/keyboard navigate through the results, or press enter to spawn a new tool to examine the selected result.\rThe following shortcuts are available:\r\r\tCtrl+Arrow_right dives in and restricts the available types of searches only to the selected element.\r\tCtrl+Shift+Arrow_right dives in and shows all the rearch results from a category.\r\tCtrl+Arrow_left dives out to the previous search\r\tCtrl+p toggles the preview pane\r\tEnter  spawns a new tool to examine the selected result\r\tCtrl+Shift+Arrow_down/Ctrl+Shift+Arrow_down navigatew through different types of searches\r\tShift highlights all butons from the UI (only works with newer VMs)\r\r!! Visual Exploration\r\rA useful way of discovering how things work in Pharo, is to point your mouse cursor at something on the screen (e.g. a browser button) and invoke a visual Halo selection by pressing: \r\r  Alt+Shift + left mouse click\r\rIf you continue clicking the left mouse button (while holding Alt+Shift), the halo will expand it's selection to the current item's parent. This is useful for traversing the lineage of graphical Morph's to see what contains what.\r\rThe halo has a series of icons, which if you hover over them will give you some balloon help about their operation. For exploring, the spanner icon is useful for letting you inspect or browse the current item to locate where the actual code is implemented.\r\rTo remove the halo,  simply click anywhere outside of the current halo.\r\rIt is possible to directly explore a visual object and bypass using the halo mechanism by pressing:\r\r  Ctrl+Shift + left mouse click\r\rThis will give you a menu for the current item with options to inspect, debug etc.\r\r! Browsing and Navigating Code\r\rFinding and navigating through code in Pharo is an important part of developing programs in Smalltalk.\r\r!! System Browser (Nautilus)\r\rThe System Browser (available in the desktop World menu), is the primary way of viewing your source code. This browser framework has been rewritten in Pharo and is often referred to as Nautilus (see the other top level help item for more technical details)\r\r!!! Showing Hierarchies\r\rNautilus defaults to a simple 'Flat' display of the list of classes that are in the currently selected package (far left). If you want to see the hierarchy of a particular class, first select it and then press (toggle) the 'Flat' button, to show show its 'Hierarchy'. Pressing this button again will toggle back to the 'Flat' model.\r\r!!! Browser History\r\rThe browser records the history of methods and classes you have visited similar to a Web Browser. The dropdown list in the middle right of the panes (above the lower text pane) shows this history, and clicking on one of its items will navigate to that item. This is convenient if you have clicked on a different package, or navigated to superclass and want to return back to where you were. \r\r!!! Customising\r\rThe system browser can also be configured with a different title as well as optional plugins. These are all available in the window dropdown menu in the top right of the title bar (normally a small triangle).\r\r!! Spotter\r\rUse the Shift+Enter global keystroke to activate a popup window that lets you incrementally search for methods, classes, packages, pragmas, files, folders and many other types of data.\r\r!! Finder \r\rThe code Finder browswer is available from the World | Tools menu. The Finder lets you enter some general text in top edit field and then categorize it as either text, or language construct in the dropdown list to refine your search. There are more detailed instructions in the bottom pane of the browser detailing the different options.\r\r!! Workspace\r\rIn any workspace you can type or select any text and then perform an 'code search' (context menu item) that will look for matching senders, implementors, references or method source.\r\r! Icons\r\rThere are many icons that are visible in the envionment, each with different meanings.\r\r!! General\r\rAn orange smudge in the top right of any editable text field indicatest that the field has been modified and should be saved with CMD+S.\r\r!! Class Pane\r\rIn the System Browser class pane, you will see the following icons appear next to specific types of class objects:\r\r- Red exclamation mark: a missing class comment. The pharo team reccommend that all classes should describe their intent with a comment. \r- Gray dot: a TestCase \r- Yellow Lightening bolt: an Exception \r- 3 Coloured Balls: a Collection \r- Blue Speech bubble: an Announcement \r- Blue Paragraph symbol: a String \r- Gray Epsilon symbol: a Magniture \r- Blue Matrix box: a graphcial Morph \r- Purple Ball with T: a Trait\r\r!! Protocol Pane\r\rIn the System Browser protocol pane, you will see the following icons appear next to specific types of protocol objects:\r\r- Yellow diamond: initialisation methods\r- Red Square: private methods\r\r!! Method Pane\r\rIn the System Browser methods pane, you will see the following icons appear next to specific types of method objects:\r\r- Green Up Arrow: indicates this method overrides a method in a super class\r- Green Down Arrow: indicates this method is overriden in a subclass\r\r!! Source Pane\r\rIn the System Browser lower code source pane, you will see the following icons appear which have the following meaning:\r\r- Orange Smudge top right: the source has changed and should be saved\r- Yellow Stripe right margin: a long or complicated method that needs refactoring\r- Yellow Padlock top right: when locked, indicates the current method source will be displayed stacked with other locked methods in the source pane\r\r!

A PragmaMenuBuilder instance is the root of a tree of MenuRegistration instances.\rThe basic principle is that each menu sub-tree is specified by a method which is tagged by a specific pragma. Such methods are dynamically retrieved and then evaluated with a MenuRegistration passed as argument (see #retrieveRegistrations). The result is a tree of MenuRegistration which roots are stored in my itemList inst. var.\rAfter the tree of MenuRegistration has been built, it is re-organized (re-organization is based on the parent declaration) and is re-ordered (based on the MenuRegistration order indications). Then the tree of MenuRegistration can serve as input for the building of a PluggableMenuSpec. The PluggableMenuSpec is itself used in order to build a MenuMorph with the help of the current ToolBuilder. (see MenuRegistration comment for more informations about how to specify menu entries).\r\rThe tree of MenuRegistration is built by #buildTree in three steps (1) the  collecting of the MenuRegistration instances (2) the re-organization and (3) the sorting:\r\r1) The first step consists in evaluating all pragma methods by passing a builder (a PragmaMenuBuilder instance) as argument. Each pragma method invocation build a sub-tree which root is added to the builder itemList collection. (see #collectRegistrations).\rAs an example, this first step could produce a tree as follow (stored in a PragmaMenuBuilder itemList inst var) :\r\t\t\t\t#Tools\t\t\t\t\t\t#'Other tool', parentName: #Tools\r\t\t\t\t/\t\\\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\r\t(#Worspace)\t(#browser)\t\t\t\t\t\t(#'Test runner' )\r\r2) The second step consists is re-organizing the tree. A MenuRegistration can be declared with a particular parent name (by sending #parent: to it with a symbol as argument). If the parentName of a MenuRegistration X is the name of another MenuRegistration Z, then it means that X must be placed as a child of Z. This is the goal of this re-arrangement step which moves badly placed nodes at their good place. (see #arrangeRegistrations).\rWith previous example, the second step produces:\r\t\t\t\t\t\t#Tools\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\t\t\t\t/\t\t|\t\t\t\\\r\t(#Worspace)\t(#browser)\t\t#'Other tool' , parentName: #Tools\r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(#'Test runner')\r\r2) The third step consists in sorting the tree according to the order inst. var. value of each MenuRegistration. This is done in two passes: the first pass tries to assign as much order inst. var. as possible (If an item is given with a specific order, then, previous and following items order can be automatically computed - see #assignOrderWithBlock: and #orderAssignBlock). The second pass consists in a smple sort according to a sort block given by #itemSortBlock.\r\r\rInstance Variables\r\tmodel:\t\t<Object>\r\tpragmaCollector:\t\t<PragmaCollection>\r\tpragmaKeywords:\t\t<Collection of Symbol>\r\tcurrentRoot: \t\t\t<MenuRegistration>\r\rmodel\r\t- Serves as the default target for the menu.

Having such interface is important to build generic tools that could manipulate \rany entities in a polymorphic way (yes no isKindOf: everywhere).\r\rIn addition, a ring method definition offers a specific interface that should only be used when you know that you are solely manipulate\rspecific entity such as class element: method definition, class comment, and variables. \r\rHere is the equivalence table\r\r\trealParent \t\t\t\trealClass\r\tparent\t\t\t\t\tringClass\r\tparentName\t\t\tclassName\r\r\r* The message class returns the class of the object :).\r\rExample:\r\t(Point>>#dist:) asRingDefinition class\r\t\t->  RingMethodDefinition\r\t\t\r* The message className returns the name of the ring class defining the reingMethodDefinition.\r\rExample:\r\t(Point>>#dist:) asRingDefinition className\r\t\t->  #Point\t\t\r\t\t\r* If you have a complete model where classes and methods are ring definition, to access the ring class definition , use parent\r\taRGMethodDefinition ringClass\r\t\rExample:\r\taRGMethodDefinition(Point>>#dist:) ringClass\r\t\t->  aRGClassDefinition(Point)\r\t\t\r\t\t\r* If you want to access the smalltalk class that contains the compiledMethod that is represented by a ringMethodDefinition, use realClass\r\taRGMethodDefinition realClass\r\t\rExample:\r\t(Point>>#dist:) asRingDefinition realClass\r\t\t->  Point\r\r","superclass":"RGElementDefinition","subclasses":[],"name":"RGMethodDefinition"},{"package":"Ring-Deprecated-Tests-Kernel","depth":5,"comment":"SUnit tests for method definitions","superclass":"TestCase","subclasses":[],"name":"RGMethodDefinitionTest"},{"package":"Ring-Deprecated-Tests-Monticello","depth":5,"comment":"SUnit tests for monticello","superclass":"TestCase","subclasses":[],"name":"RGMonticelloTest"},{"package":"Ring-Deprecated-Core-Containers","depth":6,"comment":"A namespace is a container that in addition to managing classes and methods, it also knows how to treat pools and global variables","superclass":"RGContainer","subclasses":[],"name":"RGNamespace"},{"package":"Ring-Deprecated-Tests-Containers","depth":5,"comment":"SUnit tests for namespaces","superclass":"TestCase","subclasses":[],"name":"RGNamespaceTest"},{"package":"Ring-Deprecated-Core-Containers","depth":5,"comment":"An organization with categories","superclass":"RGAbstractContainer","subclasses":[],"name":"RGOrganization"},{"package":"Ring-Deprecated-Core-Containers","depth":6,"comment":"RGPackage is the representation for packages.\rA package manages classes, methods and children packages as elements.\rA package can also know in which package is defined\r","superclass":"RGContainer","subclasses":[],"name":"RGPackage"},{"package":"Ring-Deprecated-Tests-Containers","depth":5,"comment":"SUnit tests for packages","superclass":"TestCase","subclasses":[],"name":"RGPackageTest"},{"package":"Ring-Deprecated-Core-Kernel","depth":6,"comment":"A pool variable definition","superclass":"RGVariableDefinition","subclasses":[],"name":"RGPoolVariableDefinition"},{"package":"Ring-Deprecated-Core-Containers","depth":6,"comment":"A slice is an arbitrary container of elements (working unit)\rBy inheritance it knows how to treat classes and methods\r","superclass":"RGContainer","subclasses":[],"name":"RGSlice"},{"package":"Ring-Deprecated-Tests-Containers","depth":5,"comment":"SUnit tests for slices","superclass":"TestCase","subclasses":[],"name":"RGSliceTest"},{"package":"Ring-Deprecated-Core-Kernel","depth":7,"comment":"RGTraitDefinition is the concrete representation of a trait (no class)","superclass":"RGTraitDescriptionDefinition","subclasses":[],"name":"RGTraitDefinition"},{"package":"Ring-Deprecated-Tests-Kernel","depth":5,"comment":"SUnit tests for trait definitions","superclass":"TestCase","subclasses":[],"name":"RGTraitDefinitionTest"},{"package":"Ring-Deprecated-Core-Kernel","depth":6,"comment":"RGTraitDescriptionDefinition is the common parent for traits and metatraits that know their users (ie. classes/metaclasses)","superclass":"RGBehaviorDefinition","subclasses":["RGMetatraitDefinition","RGTraitDefinition"],"name":"RGTraitDescriptionDefinition"},{"package":"Ring-Deprecated-Core-Kernel","depth":5,"comment":"A variable definition","superclass":"RGElementDefinition","subclasses":["RGClassInstanceVariableDefinition","RGClassVariableDefinition","RGInstanceVariableDefinition","RGPoolVariableDefinition"],"name":"RGVariableDefinition"},{"package":"Ring-Deprecated-Tests-Kernel","depth":5,"comment":"SUnit tests for variable definitions","superclass":"TestCase","subclasses":[],"name":"RGVariableDefinitionTest"},{"package":"RPackage-Core","depth":3,"comment":"A RPackage is a new implementation of package.

This has to be done explictly.

This dedicated object implements a #lookupMenu method for this.\rBy default, it is the textArea itself (see RubAbstractTextArea>>defaultGetMenuPolicy). \rThe policy can be changed with RubAbstractTextArea>>#getMenuPolicy:, by passing whatever object that answer to #lookupMenu.\r\rInstance Variables\r\teditingMode:\t\t<Object>\r\teditingState:\t\t<Object>\r\teditor:\t\t<Object>\r\thasFocus:\t\t<Object>\r\tholder:\t\t<Object>\r\tmargins:\t\t<Object>\r\tmenuAllowed:\t\t<Object>\r\tmodel:\t\t<Object>\r\tparagraph:\t\t<Object>\r\treadOnly:\t\t<Object>\r\tscrollPivot:\t\t<Object>\r\ttext:\t\t<Object>\r\ttextColor:\t\t<Object>\r\ttextStyle:\t\t<Object>\r\twrapped:\t\t<Object>\r\reditingMode\r\t- xxxxx\r\reditingState\r\t- xxxxx\r\reditor\r\t- xxxxx\r\rhasFocus\r\t- xxxxx\r\rholder\r\t- xxxxx\r\rmargins\r\t- xxxxx\r\rmenuAllowed\r\t- xxxxx\r\rmodel\r\t- xxxxx\r\rparagraph\r\t- xxxxx\r\rreadOnly\r\t- xxxxx\r\rscrollPivot\r\t- xxxxx\r\rtext\r\t- xxxxx\r\rtextColor\r\t- xxxxx\r\rtextStyle\r\t- xxxxx\r\rwrapped\r\t- xxxxx\r\r\r","superclass":"Morph","subclasses":["RubEditingArea","RubTextFieldArea"],"name":"RubAbstractTextArea"},{"package":"Rubric-Tests","depth":5,"comment":"A RubAbstractTextAreaTest is a test class for testing the behavior of RubAbstractTextArea","superclass":"TestCase","subclasses":["RubEditingAreaTest"],"name":"RubAbstractTextAreaTest"},{"package":"Rubric","depth":6,"comment":"RubAdornmentDisplayer adds a simple adornment for text area","superclass":"RubScrolledTextExtraSurface","subclasses":[],"name":"RubAdornmentDisplayer"},{"package":"Rubric","depth":6,"comment":"I represent a bar with annotations for the text area, like editing mode, line numbers etc","superclass":"RubScrolledTextSideRuler","subclasses":[],"name":"RubAnnotationDisplayer"},{"package":"Rubric","depth":4,"comment":"I am an abstract announcement class.

The User interface\rA SettingBrowser allows the browsing as well as the editing of setting values.\rFor each setting, a label and an input widget allowing the change of the setting value are shown.\r\r!! Browsing standards settings\rIn order to open a setting browser one can also use the expression below:\r--------------------\rSettingBrowser open\r--------------------\rIt opens a SettingBrowser for all settings declared with the standard 'systemsettings' pragma keyword. \rTo see how these settings are declared in the image, you can browse all senders of #systemsettings:\r--------------\rSystemNavigation new  browseAllSendersOf: #systemsettings\r--------------\r\r!! Browsing application specific settings\rFor specific applications, other pragma keywords can be used. These keywords can be passed as follow:\r--------------------\r(SettingBrowser forKeywords: #('blob')) open.\r--------------------\rThen, only settings which are declared with the keyword 'blob' are viewed. \rHere is an example of such a setting declared in the class side of a class BlobSettings \r--------------------\rBlobSettings class>>blobSettingOn: aBuilder\r\t<blob>\r\t(aBuilder group: #blobEditing) \r\t\tlabel: 'Editing' translated;\r\t\tparent: #blobBrowsing; \r\t\tdescription: 'All settings concerned with blob editing' translated;\r\t\twith: [\t\r\t\t\t(aBuilder setting: #color)\t...\r--------------------\rThe expression 'SettingBrowser open' is then equivalent to the '(SettingBrowser forKeywords: #('systemsettings')) open' expression.\r\r!! Filtering\rThe SettingBrowser has a filtering functionality to limitate the number of settings. You can enter a token in the input field of the toolbar in order to show only settings that are matching the token.\rTwo filtering modes are allowed:  with a substring or with a regular expression.\r- with a substring: only settings which name, description, pragma class or method selector includes this substring are viewed; \r- with a regular expression: the same as with a substring except that the input is used as a regular expression. This filtering is applied if the Regexp checkbox is checked.\r\r! How to declare a setting\rA setting is declared with a method class side. This kind of method takes a builder as argument and a standard setting is tagged with the <systemsettings> pragma. The builder argument serves as a facade for the declaration.\r\r!!A simple boolean setting example\r\rLet's start with a setting declaration example:\rCodeHolderSystemSettings class>>caseSensitiveFindsSettingsOn: aBuilder\r\t<systemsettings>\r\t(aBuilder setting: #caseSensitiveFinds) \r\t\tlabel: 'Case sensitive search' translated;\r\t\tdescription: 'If true, then the \"find\" command in text will always make its searches in a case-sensitive fashion' translated;\r\t\tsetSelector: #caseSensitiveFinds:;\r\t\tgetSelector: #caseSensitiveFinds;\r\t\ttarget: TextEditor;\r\t\tparent: #codeEditing.\r\rFor this setting to be declared, we make the asumption that we have TextEditor class>>caseSensitiveFinds and TextEditor class>>caseSensitiveFinds: methods in order to change the preference value. \rTo declare a setting, just send #setting: to the builder with its identifier, a Symbol passed as argument. It creates a setting node. Then you can set the label, the description with #label: and #description sent to the newly created setting node. You also have to set the selectors for setting and getting the preference value as well as the target to which these accessors are sent  (often a class). This is done by sending respectively, #setSelector:, #getSelector: and #target: to the setting node.\rBecause all settings are organized in trees we need a way to indicate what is the position of the setting node in the overall setting trees list. In fact it can be done two ways. The first way is to use the #parent: message (A second possibility is to declare a subtree in one method, it is explained later in this documentation).The #parent: message is send for non root settings. #parent takes the identifier of the parent setting as argument.\r\rYou may notice that in this example,  if we don't take into account the $: at the end of the setting accessor, the getting and the setting accessors are the same. This is often the case. You can simply set the setter and the getter by sending the #selector: message to the setting node. Thus the declaration is simplified as follow:\rCodeHolderSystemSettings class>>caseSensitiveFindsSettingsOn: aBuilder\r\t<systemsettings>\r\t(aBuilder setting: #caseSensitiveFinds) \r\t\tlabel: 'Case sensitive search' translated;\r\t\tdescription: 'If true, then the \"find\" command in text will always make its searches in a case-sensitive fashion' translated;\r\t\tselector: #caseSensitiveFinds;\r\t\ttarget: TextEditor;\r\t\tparent: #codeEditing.\r\rYou may also notice that the identifier of the setting is then the same as the selector. In this case, you can omit to set the selector because by default, the identifier is used as the selector for getting the preference value and the identifier concatenated with a $: at the end is used as the setting selector. Thus the declaration is simplified again as follow:\rCodeHolderSystemSettings class>>caseSensitiveFindsSettingsOn: aBuilder\r\t<systemsettings>\r\t(aBuilder setting: #caseSensitiveFinds) \r\t\tlabel: 'Case sensitive search' translated;\r\t\tdescription: 'If true, then the \"find\" command in text will always make its searches in a case-sensitive fashion' translated;\r\t\ttarget: TextEditor;\r\t\tparent: #codeEditing.\r\rFinally, if you decide to declare a setting directly in the class which implements the selector, the target information can be also omitted because the class in which the setting is declared is used by default. Thus the simplest declaration can be:\rTextEditor class>>caseSensitiveFindsSettingsOn: aBuilder\r\t<systemsettings>\r\t(aBuilder setting: #caseSensitiveFinds) \r\t\tlabel: 'Case sensitive search' translated;\r\t\tdescription: 'If true, then the \"find\" command in text will always make its searches in a case-sensitive fashion' translated;\r\t\tparent: #codeEditing.\r\r!!Declaring a subtree in one single method\rDirectly declaring a sub-tree of settings in one method is also possible. Then, typically, a root group is declared for the application settings and the children settings themselves are also declared within the same method as in the example below in which #formatCommentWithStatements and #indentString are directly declared as children of the #configurableFormatter setting:\r\rRBConfigurableFormatter class>>settingsOn: aBuilder\r\t<systemsettings>\t\r\t(aBuilder group: #configurableFormatter)\r\t\ttarget: self;\r\t\tparent: #refactoring;\r\t\tlabel: 'Configurable Formatter' translated;\r\t\tdescription: 'Settings related to the formatter' translated;\r\t\twith: [\r\t\t\t(aBuilder setting: #formatCommentWithStatements)\r\t\t\t\tlabel: 'Format comment with statements' translated.\r\t\t\t(aBuilder setting: #indentString)\r\t\t\t\tlabel: 'Indent string' translated]\r\r!!Optional setting\rAny setting can have children. In the case where a boolean setting is used as a parent, then, its children are chown only if the parent preference value is true.\r\r!!Range setting\rYou send the #range: message to the builder instead of the #setting: message. In addition, you send the #range: message to the setting with an interval as argument in order to indicate the valid range.\rscreenMarginSettingOn: aBuilder\r\t<systemsettings>\r\t(aBuilder range: #fullscreenMargin)\r\t\ttarget: SystemWindow;\r\t\tparent: #windows;\r\t\tlabel: 'Fullscreen margin' translated;\r\t\tdescription: 'Specify the amount of space that is let around a windows when it''s opened fullscreen' translated;\r\t\trange: (-5 to: 100).\r\r!!List setting\rFor this kind of setting, the SettingBrowser will show a drop list. Here is an example for the window position strategy. Notice that the setting is declared by sending the #pickOne message to the builder. Notice also that the list of valid values are given by sending the #domainValues: message to the setting. The argument is an array of association. Each association key is the label that is shown and the corresponding association value gives the value that will be assigned to the preference.\rwindowPositionStrategySettingsOn: aBuilder\r\t<systemsettings>\r\t(aBuilder pickOne: #usedStrategy) \r\t\tlabel: 'Window position strategy' translated;\r\t\ttarget: RealEstateAgent;\r\t\tdomainValues: {\r\t\t\t'Reverse Stagger' translated -> #staggerFor:initialExtent:world:. \r\t\t\t'Cascade' translated -> #cascadeFor:initialExtent:world:. \r\t\t\t'Standard' translated -> #standardFor:initialExtent:world:};\r\r!!Launcher\rA launcher is a particular setting. It allows to launch a script directly from the setting browser. Imagine that you have changed some settings and that you need to evaluate a script in order to update some other objets. It can be used also to configurate globally a package of the entire image.\rAs an example, in order to use True Type Fonts, the system must be updated by collecting all the available TT fonts. This can be done by evaluating the following expression:\r-------------\rFreeTypeFontProvider current updateFromSystem\r-------------\rIn order to be able to launch this script from the setting browser, you have to declare a launcher. For example, look-at how the script for the TT fonts is declared in GraphicFontSettings class >> #standardFontsSettingsOn:.\r\rGraphicFontSettings class >> #standardFontsSettingsOn:\r\t<systemsettings>\r\t(aBuilder group: #standardFonts)\r\t\t...\r\t\t(aBuilder launcher: #updateFromSystem)\r\t\t\t\torder: 1; \r\t\t\t\ttarget: FreeTypeFontProvider;\r\t\t\t\ttargetSelector: #current;\r\t\t\t\tdescription: 'Update available fonts by scanning the current system';\r\t\t\t\tscript: #updateFromSystem;\r\t\t\t\tlabel: 'Update fonts from system' translated.\r\rNotice that you send #launcher: to the builder in order to create the setting node, then you send #script: to the created node with the selector of the script passed as argument.\r</help>\r\rImplementation details\rSee also SettingNode, SettingTree, SettingNodeBuilder and SettingTreeBuilder classes.\r\rInstance Variables\r\troots:\t\t<Collection of SettingTreeNode>\r\tsearchedText:\t\t<String>\r\tstatus:\t\t<WriteStream>\r\tcollector:\t\t<SettingCollector>\r\rroots\r\t- the roots of the viewed setting trees\r\rsearchedText\r\t- the string used as a filter token or regexp in order to select viewed settings\r\rstatus\r\t- a WriteStream used in order to store useful information which are shown when no current item is selected\r\rcollector\r\t- The SettingCollector which has the responsibility to collect settings and to build viewed trees\r","superclass":"MorphTreeModel","subclasses":[],"name":"SettingBrowser"},{"package":"System-Settings-Tests","depth":5,"comment":"A SettingBrowserTest is a test class for testing the behavior of SettingBrowser","superclass":"TestCase","subclasses":[],"name":"SettingBrowserTest"},{"package":"System-Settings-Core","depth":5,"comment":"A SettingDeclaration is an handler for a writtable setting value. \rIts main responsibility is allow real value changing and to hold descriptive data about the setting.

A Socket is a two way communication link with two logically separate channels - input and output. The Socket class is the lowest level in Pharo for network communication and using it directly can be difficult and bug prone.\r\rA SocketStream can be in binary or ascii mode, ascii is the default which means you are transmitting and receiving Strings. Most Internet protocols are in clear text ascii, like for example HTTP. Another setting is what timeout you want to use - default is the standardTimeout from Socket. More settings can be found in the method category 'configuration'.\r\rSimplest example of connecting, sending/receiving and closing:\r\r| stream result |\rstream := SocketStream openConnectionToHostNamed: 'www.pharo-project.org' port: 80.\r[[stream nextPutAll: 'GET / HTTP/1.0'; crlf; crlf; flush.\rresult := stream upToEnd. \"Give us all data until the socket is closed.\"\rTranscript show: result; cr.]\r\tensure: [stream close]]\r\t\ton: ConnectionTimedOut\r\t\tdo: [:ex | Transcript show: ex asString;cr. ex resume]\r\rThere are two important things to note above:\r\t- The methods in category \"stream in\" can signal two exceptions (unless turned off with #shouldSignal:):\r\t\tConnectionClosed and ConnectionTimedOut\r\t- We close the stream using #ensure:, that is to make sure it isn't left opened.\r\t- We use #on:do: to catch any signal. In this case we do not need to catch ConnectionClosed since #upToEnd does that for us intrinsically.\r\r----------------\rSocketStream (below called SS) is a reimplementation of 'Old'-SocketStream (below called OSS) - the class that originates from the original Comanche implementation but now is included in standard Squeak. SS has the same protocol as OSS and is meant to replace it. SS is faster, more flexible, is better documented and adds a few features:\r\r1. #shouldSignal:, which decides if SS should signal low level Socket exceptions (true) or if it should swallow them like original OSS did. Default is true. The only reason I added this is for backwards compatibility - not signalling causes problems - see bug 4 below.\r\r2. #nextAllInBuffer, #nextInBuffer:, #skip:, #receiveData:, #nextPutAllFlush: and #recentlyRead are new additions to the public protocol.\r\r\rIt also fixes various bugs:\r\r1. #isDataAvailable could theoretically answer false, when there actually is some in the buffer in OSS. If #receiveDataIfAvailable reads the last byte then the following \"socket dataAvailable\" would answer false. So the last byte would be sitting in the inStream missed.\r\r2. #upToAll: in OSS has several problems, for example - #positionOfSubCollection:ifAbsent: which was introduced answers one position too low. This was compensated in upToAll:, but only in the pushBack: call, not the actual result being returned which was cut short 1 byte. Amusingly this makes KomHttpServer not use \"Keep-Alive\" since the last $e in 'Alive' was cut short. :)\r\r3. SS doesn't inherit from PositionableStream since that just breaks various inherited messages, like for example #skip:. OSS should IMHO be changed to inherit from Object - or of course, replaced in full with SS. :)\r\r4. Since SocketStream by default signals closes and timeouts the SocketStreamTest now passes. The reason for SocketStream to fail is that while it does timeout on a low level (#SocketStream>>receiveData doesn't hang forever) - the callers of #receiveData sometimes loop - like in #next:, and thus eliminates the timeout. SS warns about some methods (in their method comments) not honouring timeouts if shouldSignal is false, I really don't know what they should do in that case:\r\t#next:, #upTo:, #upToAll: and #upToEnd (and #receiveData:)\r\r\rThe primary reason for the SS implementation is optimal performance. The main differences in implementation with the old OSS are:\r\r1. SS uses two buffers directly (inBuffer and outBuffer) with pointers marking start and stop within the buffer. OSS instead uses two regular streams, a ReadStream and a WriteStream. Using internal buffers makes it possible to avoid copying and reallocation in various ways, it also makes SS be able to have specialized growing/buffer moving behaviour.\r\r2. #upTo:, #upToAll: and #peekForAll: uses selectged String messages that in turn uses fast primitives for searching. OSS used other messages that fell back on byte per byte reading.\r\r3. #receiveData in OSS creates a temporary buffer stream for each call! During a long read operation, like say #upToAll: (which for example is used when uploading files using HTTP POST forms), this is devastating - especially since the default size is only 2000 bytes - and leads to a very high number of low level read operations on the Socket, typically 100 times more calls than with OSS. The buffer in OSS is held in an instvar (not recreated for each call), is larger from the start and above all - grows dynamically by doubling. OSS can also avoid a grow/reallocation by doing a \"move down\" if data has been read from the SS as it comes in and through that making room in the lower part of the inBuffer. The net result is that upToAll: for large files is about 10 times faster.\r\r4. The implementation of upTo: and upToAll: tries to avoid doing unnecessary find operations in the buffer and is greedy by default, which means it favors reading more data - if available - before searching for the stop sequence. If we had #findString:startingAt:stoppingAt: this wouldn't have to be greedy and we wouldn't be needlessly scanning dead buffer area. VM hackers? Also, while you are at it - make it work for ByteArrays too. :)\r\r\rSS can not be run unbuffered, since that seems unneeded. The option to autoFlush is still available, with it set to true SocketStream (just like OSS) will flush on its own on each nextPut:/nextPutAll:, otherwise flushing it will have to be done manually but is done on close.\r\rThe first performance tests shows that, as noted above, receiving large amounts of data using #upToAll: is greatly improved - factor of 10. Serving HTTP with small payloads seemed at first not be faster at all - but this is due to the high overhead of Socket connect/close and other things. Increasing payloads show a difference and especially with keep alive on - where the new SS roughly doubles the throughput!","superclass":"Object","subclasses":[],"name":"SocketStream"},{"package":"Network-Tests","depth":6,"comment":"SUnit tests for socket streams","superclass":"ClassTestCase","subclasses":[],"name":"SocketStreamTest"},{"package":"Network-Tests","depth":5,"comment":"SUnit tests for sockets","superclass":"TestCase","subclasses":[],"name":"SocketTest"},{"package":"Balloon","depth":4,"comment":"SolidFillStyle is a fill which represents a color for the BalloonEngine.\r\rInstance variables:\r\tcolor\t<Color>\tThe color to use.\r\tpixelValue32 <Integer>\tThe cached pixel value to use.","superclass":"FillStyle","subclasses":["ColorFillStyle"],"name":"SolidFillStyle"},{"package":"SortFunctions-Core","depth":3,"comment":"I am intended to be used in place of two arg sort blocks.\r\rUsage\r\rIn the following example, an ascending SortFunction is created based on the result of the #first message send to each object.\r#(#(1 2) #(2 3) #(0 0)) sorted: #first ascending.\r\rTo sort by the #last element, but descending, the following would be used:\r#(#(1 2) #(2 3) #(0 0)) sorted: #last descending.\r\rOne can use blocks as well.

This self-containedness makes a test more robust.  Use TestResources only for objects that are needed by several tests and that are too 'expensive' (in time or otherwise) to recreate and destroy for each test.  A viable approach is to develop the code in MyTestCase's #setUp and #tearDown methods, then at some point refactor the code into the #setUp and #tearDown of a TestResource whose class is added to MyTestCase class>>resource method.\r\rTestResource uses the singleton pattern.  A TestResource class will set up a single instance of itself when first requested and tear it down again at the end of TestSuite>>run (or TestCase>>run, >>debug and >>debugAsFailure).  Normally, a TestResource, once setUp, remains active during the running of all remaining tests and is #reset after all tests have run.  For an exception, see subclass CompetingResource in SUnitResourcePatterns.  Users can choose to #reset a resource in the #tearDown of a test that alters it, sacrificing the performance gain of having a single #setUp of the resource for the certainty that other tests using it will not see the alterations.  Generally however, this should be the exception:  if you need to reset the resource for every test that uses it, its code should just be part of your test's #setUp and #tearDown code.\r\rTo use, create a subclass of TestResource and override the following:\r\t- TestCase class>>resources, to return a collection including the TestResource class, for all test case classes that need it\r\t\t* a TestCase' resources are set up in the order returned and torn down in the reverse order\r\t- TestResource class>>resources, if the resource itself always needs some other resource to be present before it can set up\r\t\t* a TestResource's resource are set up before it and torn down after it, and are set up in the order returned and torn down in the reverse order\r\t- TestResource>>setUp and tearDown, to define initial and final behaviour (just like a test)\r\t- TestResource>>isAvailable, to return true if it is and false if it isn't (the framework calls this after setUp);  ideally, this call should not change the resource' state - that should be done in setUp\r\rTestResource implements the singleton pattern in its class-side #isAvailable and #reset methods.  Do not override these when creating specific resources;  unless you are developing a whole new pattern of use, it will always be correct to override instance-side #setUp, #tearDown and #isAvailable, and dangerous to override class>>isAvailable, class>>isAlreadyAvailable and class>>reset.\r\rGenerally, users do not code interactions with a test's resources during the running of a test.  Code that reads a resource' values while leaving its state strictly alone is safe enough.  A test must leave a resource in a clean state:  always use #reset if a test must protect later-running tests from unsafe changes (and review whether in such a case a resource is the right thing to use in the first place).\r\rSee my superclass' comment for assertion and logging information.\r","superclass":"TestAsserter","subclasses":["SimpleTestResource","WithForkedProcessTestResource","EpTestLogBuilder","TraitsResource","GoferResource","UnicodeTestRNG","MetacelloAlternateResource","MetacelloAtomicConfigurationResource","MetacelloAtomicMonticelloResource","MetacelloConfigurationResource","MetacelloIssue108Resource","MetacelloMonticelloResource","MetacelloScriptingResource","MCSnapshotResource","DiskFileAttributesTestsResources","StdioStreamTestResource"],"name":"TestResource"},{"package":"SUnit-Tests","depth":5,"comment":"SUnit tests for forked processes in test resources","superclass":"TestCase","subclasses":[],"name":"TestResourceWithForkedProcessTestCase"},{"package":"SUnit-Core","depth":3,"comment":"This implements the Collecting Parameter pattern for running a bunch of tests.

They also support reasonable text-editing capabilities, as well as embedded hot links, and the ability to embed submorphs in the text.\r\rLate in life, TextMorph was made a subclass of BorderedMorph to provide border and background color if desired.  In order to keep things compatible, protocols have been redirected so that color (preferably textColor) relates to the text, and backgroundColor relates to the inner fill color.\r\rText display is clipped to the innerBounds of the rectangle, and text composition is normally performed within a rectangle which is innerBounds inset by the margins parameter.\r\rIf text has been embedded in another object, one can elect to fill the owner's shape, in which case the text will be laid out in the shape of the owner's shadow image (including any submorphs other than the text).  One can also elect to have the text avoid occlusions, in which case it will avoid the bounds of any sibling morphs that appear in front of it.  It may be necessary to update bounds in order for the text runaround to notice the presence of a new occluding shape.\r\rThe optional autoFitContents property enables the following feature:  if the text contents changes, then the bounds of the morph will be adjusted to fit the minimum rectangle that encloses the text (plus any margins specified).  Similarly, any attempt to change the size of the morph will be resisted if this parameter is set.  Except...\r\rIf the wrapFlag parameter is true, then text will be wrapped at word boundaries based on the composition width (innerBounds insetBy: margins) width.  Thus an attempt to resize the morph in autofit mode, if it changes the width, will cause the text to be recomposed with the new width, and then the bounds will be reset to the minimum enclosing rectangle.  Similarly, if the text contents are changed with the wrapFlag set to true, word wrap will be performed based on the current compostion width, after which the bounds will be set (or not), based on the autoFitcontents property.\r\rNote that fonts can only be applied to the TextMorph as a whole.  While you can change the size, color, and emphasis of a subsection of the text and have it apply to only that subsection, changing the font changes the font for the entire contents of the TextMorph. \r\rStill a TextMorph can be composed of several texts of different fonts\r| font1 font2 t1 t2 tMorph|\rtMorph := TextMorph new.\rfont1 := (TextFontReference toFont: (StrikeFont familyName: 'Atlanta' size: 22)).\rfont2 := (TextFontReference toFont: (StrikeFont familyName: 'Atlanta' size: 11)).\rt1 := 'this is font1' asText addAttribute: font1.\rt2 := ' and this is font2' asText addAttribute: font2.\rtMorph contents: (t1,t2).\rtMorph openInHand.\r\r\rYet to do:\rMake a comprehensive control for the eyedropper, with border width and color, inner color and text color, and margin widths.","superclass":"BorderedMorph","subclasses":["GrowlMorph","TextMorphForEditView","IceTipReadOnlyTextMorph"],"name":"TextMorph"},{"package":"Morphic-Base","depth":6,"comment":"I'm a TextMorph that must be embedded in a PluggableTextMorph.\rMulti-line text editor with support for accepting on both each change and/or when keyboard focus changes.
